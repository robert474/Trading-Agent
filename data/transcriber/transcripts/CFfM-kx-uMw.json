  "text": " Hey, I'm Bill Fanter, founder of Options Action, and you're watching the weekly watchlist. If you'd like to get access to this content before it goes live on YouTube, just hit the first link in the description to sign up for our free weekly emails. Alright, let's jump right in. Hey, welcome back everybody. This is going to be the watchlist for Monday, December 8th. So we have a jam packed week of data that is going to definitely sway the market one way or the other. So the good news is on Monday, we don't have anything. As you can see here, Tuesday, we're going to have job openings. So again, remember the Fed has two mandates. One of them is making sure that we have full employment and the two is making sure that we have inflation under control. So the job openings is going to be important on Tuesday to see what is happening. Now the numbers from last week clearly show that hiring is slowing, especially with small to mid-size companies. Okay, and that's most likely due to the tariffs, right? They have uncertainty around what their cost of goods are going to be and tariffs are going to literally impact their margins. They probably can't pass on those higher tariffs to their consumer, especially if prices or the tariffs are 30, 40, 50, 100%. Okay, so we are definitely seeing large corporations still maintaining the hiring. Why? Because they can absorb the overall cost of goods. Smaller companies can't do that. It's a real struggle for them. Now Wednesday is going to be the deciding factor as to directionally, how does the market finish the year? We have our FOMC interest rate decision that's going to be a two o'clock PM Eastern Standard time. So we will not be trading Wednesday morning. It makes absolutely zero sense. I would encourage you to just sit out the morning. The reason being is options premiums are so darn expensive. They are two to three times more expensive than on a normal trading day. So if you don't get the direction correct from a bias, you are going to literally watch your contracts degrade in value by 2230% in a matter of seconds. Okay? That's why I say just at least sit out, let the FOMC rate decision come out, which is again two o'clock PM. And then if you want to trade around the actual press conference, I would highly advise you wait till the press conference is over. Although sometimes Jerome Powell talks so long that you're literally going way into power hour. And then that's where variability then becomes even more uncertain. So best thing you could possibly do is just take Wednesday off and then come back and let's see what happens Thursday. Thursday more data, initial jobless claims, the US trade deficit, and then Friday, we really don't have anything other than wholesale inventories. Let's take a look at earnings. So we don't have too much on the earnings front this week. Couple that I am going to look at with you on the charts is we're going to look at Lulam and Costco and Restoration Hardware. These are three that will typically garner a lot of attention. The other one to probably look at too is Oracle. So let me go ahead and throw that on the list. Oracle is your recall after last earnings was up in insane amount of money and they gave it all back. So why was that? Their debt servicing and the cost of debt has literally gone through the roof. So while everyone was insanely bullish, and if you were to go back and watch my weekly watch list from that week, I had even shared that what Oracle was portraying for future earnings growth was unsustainable. It was actually laughable. And clearly the market figured that out and sold it all the way back off. Okay, so that's what we got going on this week. Let's jump into some of the charts. Spy, we are almost back to all time highs, right? Market all time highs are 689. We're currently sitting at 685. So is it plausible that we hit new all time highs this week? Yeah, absolutely. Let me go ahead and fix that for you here. But you can see, right, holding steady over Friday, pretty darn, pretty darn strong here, did not want to close below 684, right? Two different attempts, two different strong bounces, 686 was resistance. We need to get above 686 to actually go higher to challenge this pivot high into the all-time high. Again, I really probably don't like a put position right now. 90% is what the market is pricing in that we are going to have a rate cut. Okay, so now if they don't deliver a rate cut, all bets are off, right? This market will sell off harder and faster than you could possibly imagine. But right now 90% of analysts believe we're going to get at least a quarter percent rate cut. 60, 50% coming into the mix, but are 50 basis points, but we'll see what happens. So there's your levels on SPY. Let's take a look at QQQ, kind of the exact same thing, right? We're just holding between these channels of 624 and 626. We do have a gap fill above, okay, in order to go higher. And then the all-time high here is 637. So we have more of a trajectory up higher for the QQQ to hit all-time highs than we do for SPY. Why is that? Well, SPY is the overall S&P 500. So we are seeing a huge broadening of the market where the Mag 7 are no longer leading, okay, they are not making new all-time highs. The only two that are beating the S&P on a performance perspective you're today is going to be Google and is going to be, excuse me, drawing a blank here, Google and Evidia. Those are the only two that are beating the S&P on a year-to-date performance basis, okay? So we got to get above 626 to go along looking for this gap fill up above. Remember, we only do gap fills on a daily basis, okay? Puts below 624, you know, we lose 620, definitely 618. And you can see how these levels are literally holding here, right? I mean, this isn't rocket science. So trade the charts, don't trade your emotions. Let's look at Apple. Apple's had a pretty decent pullback. It did make new all-time highs this week, up here at 288. We're now back down to 280. Not a lot of drop, but where I would have expected it to bounce was from a pivot low to a pivot high. And guess what? It rejected the 618 fib. So we are now consolidating in here, okay? So what I would watch for is can they hold this consolidation zone to move higher? But I really don't like puts, unless we get below this 277 to see, really, is this thing going to flush a little bit lower? Let's go ahead and take a look, even from a supply and demand perspective, right? We got a lot of buyers down here, guys. So not something that I really want to short. If anything, I really do like calls down here at 277. And then be careful of this pivot down here, right? This 276. This is kind of where I would look for an interim level to say, wow, they really held this, you know, area right here, pretty darn tight, which looks like it's going to be around 276. So this is where you'll see a blue line on my charts for an interim level, okay? The fib is dead so we could go ahead and remove that. Watch this for overall consolidation back on the way up. Amazon, a lot of so off in this again, after making some really good highs up here, back to 239, back down to 229, consolidating again, look for a push higher or lower if we break 228.76. So let's go ahead and take a look at this on a higher time frame. We'll look at it on a four hour and you can again, see, right, where they pushed it up to these highs dramatically. And now we are selling off just a bit. Now if you want to look for a good bounce area, what you could do is you could do a fib, okay, from a pivot low on a higher time frame. So this is a four hour to a pivot high and look at where they bounce this literally right here at the 55. Now we are consolidating. I would expect for this to head higher before I would expect it to head lower. So we'll keep that one on watch. Let's look at Microsoft. Microsoft again, same thing. This one is head relative weakness, interestingly enough, right? Came up here almost a double top at 555, quite a bit of cell down pressure. We are still in a downward trend, although we do have a small gap on the daily right above. Now we did close above 480, okay, and what I would look for is when we get to the bottom of this gap fill, will they reject it in head lower or will we have relative strength to move higher? We could do the exact same thing, right? We could take a fib from a pivot high to a pivot low to look for a reject. Where's that reject at, guys? Literally lines up with the bottom of the box for the retracement, right? Here is the top of the golden zone, the top of the box, okay? So keep an eye on this for a potential reject or a potential push higher to fill it to the upside. Let's take a look at Google. So I'm going to go ahead and change that. Make sure you're using GOGL, not GOG. We do have a gap fill below. We have relative strength here, right? So as the market is pulling back, Google is really not pulling back. We're holding a price level here on a four hour. Let's go ahead and take a look at the one hour. We are still bullish structure overall. I would be looking for calls back up to all time highs and not puts, right? Now again, the FOMC rate decision is going to, you know, play heavily into this waiting. You can see we do have quite a bit of resistance, ideally, you know, this would be a better buy zone, but I don't know that you're going to get a pullback to this 313. Maybe something to keep an eye on, but right now I like the price level where we're sitting right now to actually take calls to push higher. Let's take a look at Tesla. Tesla also relative strength. Okay. This one has been trending up over the last several hours. We're holding our price level of 452 is three a charm, right? So every time we get up here, they sell it off hard, right? We get up here. They sell it off hard. We get up. They sell it off. We get up here. We get up here for them to run again to this 466. We are holding this on the higher time frames, which is good. Okay. What I would look for again, can we get a pullback here to 452 for you to take calls to go long all the way up to 466? Let's take a look at Meta. Meta was interesting, right? It was up 8% pre-market on Friday and then they sold it off pretty darn hard and now we are recovering some of that. Now we do have a daily gap that is formed below and no, where did they bounce it? After they ran it up in the pre-market and they sold it off, they bounced it at the top of the gap on more than one occasion. So this, we also have a very big gap above. I really thought that they were going to try to run for this thing on Friday, but they didn't. They actually sold into it. So while this stock was up over three, I'm sorry, 8% pre-market. It only finished up the day up three and change. So let's keep an eye on this one, but I do like Meta for the long term push higher. Take a look at Nvidia. Nvidia has just been kind of consolidating here. Lot of chop back and forth. I'm going to go to a four hour time frame. You can just see that it is over the last several days, right? Just chopping up and down between this 179 and 184. So this one's been a little bit harder to trade. If you come down to a one hour time frame, you'll see that the margin has actually gotten even more narrow, right? This was Friday where they just kept pulling this 181, 181, 181. And they'd only push it to about 184. Well, $3 on $180 stock is not much price movement. So again, these levels are all really good. 184, 183, 181, 179. This is what I would use to actually trade off of. Go to AMD, another like minded chip company. Again, we had this insane relative weakness. Okay, and this was a lot was driven off of Google and Google's chips. But look at how we are holding this 214 level. So again, down here at 214, I think you could go long break below 214 with some weakness. Go short. Okay. So keep an eye on that. You could see again, back here, right? If we go all the way back to October 3rd, same exact thing that this is really an area that we keep bouncing off of and they have not started to close the gap to the downside. So if we get overall market weakness, that's what I would look to go lower. And again, chart your gap on the daily and leave them there. So get palantir. PLTR. This one, another good market sentiment. But overall relative strength. This one I like for longs. I do not like puts. We are way above the 50% and 618 Fibri Tracement. So if I was to go to, let's just do a four hour and you could see this. Once you get past the 618 Fib, we are bullish. So let's do a Fib from a pivot high, all time pivot high, down to the top. All time pivot high, down to this most recent low. And look at where this is having relative strength and consolidating in the golden zone. We are not rejecting the 50. We could reject up here at this 184 61, which is the top of the golden zone. But if we don't, I would definitely believe that palantir is going to go higher. So right now, no sign of a reject. Lots of strength. Lots of buying pressure. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. I mean, all week they were buying this thing. So do not look for puts. I would definitely look for calls. And I'm going to go ahead and save that Fib right there. I told you I was going to look at some of the earners this week. So we have Lulu. Lulu is now actually on Friday entered into the gap fill. So this is where they had prior earnings and they just sold it off exponentially. This is on a four hour time frame. What I'd love to see us do is pull back to the bottom of this gap fill to go long. Okay. Now they do have earnings coming out this week on Thursday. So again, could we get more relative strength to close this gap? Absolutely. So do ahead, go ahead, put the gap on here. What you might also want to do. Just for confluence sake is go ahead and indicate where it made it through the gap, which is about 50% of the way. So if I were to take a fib from this pivot here and we're on a four hour time frame, and I could take it from either of these right, I could take it from here or I could take it from here. Okay. Down to this pivot low. Let's see where we're sitting. We are literally sitting above the 618. Okay. That is bullish. Okay. For them to go to the 786. If we take the fib from this pivot, which was right before earnings, let's see where we're at. So we're going to be a more conservative approach. We are again holding the 618. So I would use the bottom of this 618 right in here as support for us to keep going higher. So do keep an eye on that for Lulu. Costco is going to be announcing earnings and Costco is actually suing the federal government over tariffs. Okay. So the hard part is does Trump retaliate against them? Does it impact their long term revenue? I don't think so. Costco makes all their money in memberships. They're not making their money necessarily on cost of good sold. Okay. So a couple of things with this one. We have a gap fill above. Keep an eye on that. Secondly, we have a very strong four hour trend line. So as long as we don't break below this trend line, I would believe that we will pull down here to go long. Now what I don't like is we did close below my price level of 895, right, which was a prior pivot back here that was holding. But you can also see that once we get down here, we get a lot of buyers that like to step in on Costco. So you're going to get a drawdown, right? And this is probably a more conservative price level. But if I was to play some of these other ones, right, let's go here and let's take a look at where do I get three solid touch points? We're again approaching the trend line that is now heading higher. So I'm going to go ahead and save this as a yellow line because it is on a four hour time frame. But again, I like longs versus puts. Okay. I don't think that I would set this one aside, especially with Walmart and their earnings and how strong it was. I think you're going to see the same thing out of Costco. Okay. And then the last one I want to, I do want to take a look at two because I don't want to shortchange you here. Restoration hardware. Uh, same thing, right? Found a base here at 139. If we can get above 166, I do love this to go longer up into the 207s. This is also a wild card on earnings, right? Earnings on Thursday. This thing moves exponentially. So when you see this thing move, it will move 5, 10, 15, 20%. I mean, it is crazy how much volatility you can see coming into this, right? And you'll see it off of prior earnings. So all the way up here at 255, all the way down to 124. I mean, holy schnikes. Talk about a haircut, right? And then we have earnings again here. And we're from 177 all the way up to 223. Okay. We have earnings here. And this one actually consolidated, didn't do too much as we were at 232 and only pulled back to 215. So I do think that this is a positive catalyst to the upside. I don't know that we're going to get any lower with our age, but time will tell. And then the last one, Oracle. So let's look at Oracle. This thing's been crazy. Here it was the last earnings guys. Look at this. 220 all the way up to 345. Are you kidding me? Like are you serious? So we created this huge gap fill and then look at how they just sold this stuff off. We are now bouncing the top of a lower gap, finding a little bit of a reprieve to actually possibly head higher. Okay. I'm going to use this pivot low here is an area that I really want to get above for us to use it as support to move on up. So what is scaring the street on this one is all of their debt, right? I mean, their free cash flow is just dropping. Their yield is dropping. They're borrowing a ton of money and they're trying to build for growth, right? And then the market really got scared on the debt service side. And it has just been selling and selling and selling and selling. So it's hard to believe that we were all the way up here, right? At these insane price levels. And I mean, look at this on a daily basis. I mean, just more bad news, more bad news, more bad news, right? So let's go ahead and if we move to the upside, let's add a pivot here. Let's go ahead and watch what they did right here where we're holding it for a couple of days. And then we lost it right around this 257. I'm going to actually plate this. I like this one better right here. Okay. 256. So this is what I would be watching right now. You take any of these lines, draw it left. You'll see it was support before it bounced. You could take this line, draw it left and you could see where it was resistance. So keep an eye on those and that's kind of what I'm watching. But for all intensive purposes, guys, it's FOMC week, you know, volatility picks up. Again, we are looking for the rate cut. It's not going to be the rate cut, but it's going to be the narrative that your own Powell is going to give. Now Trump also came out and said he's already picked a new Fed governor, but he's not telling us who it is until after the new year. And the names that are floated out there in a lot of state Wall Street did not like. So we'll see what actually comes to fruition. But with that, everybody, have a fantastic trading week. And if there's anything I can do to help, just reach out and ask. We'll talk to you all next Sunday. Take care. Thanks for watching.
