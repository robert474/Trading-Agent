  "text": " Hey, good morning, everybody. I'm gonna give it a second and we'll just let everybody get into the webinar and then we'll be ready to kick it off. I'm going to do Q&A, so if you have questions or anything that you want to put in the chat, go ahead and I'll help narrate those questions as we move through the presentation this morning. So, but good morning, good morning, good morning. Happy FOMC day, right? Where options premiums make zero cents and the market creates more losers than winners. Hey, good morning, guys. For those of you joining, we get started in a minute here. And then again, if you have questions, just go ahead and type them in the chat. And I'll be more than happy to make sure that they get answered for you as we progress through this. All right, Alberto, why don't we go ahead and get started? Because I do know that this is recorded. So I'll upload the presentation into the Discord later this afternoon. So if anybody joins late, I also want to be respective of your time and everybody else's. So I'm going to go ahead and turn the presentation over to you, my friend. Awesome, good morning, good morning, Bill. Indeed, the premiums will just make a bunch of losers for those who are going to be out there. One thing, Bill, I just saw it coming through the Discord. The chat, they're saying that the chat button is disabled. So I want to check on that. Hey, good morning, everyone. So as you guys know, one of the things that we are doing with options, actions on the Discord, is we're trying to give you guys another tool in your tool belt, right? And one of the things that we want you guys to really consider and think about is just, there's not a one size fits all, right? You take a little bit of here, you take a little bit of there, and really kind of like what makes sense to you. And information is great. So long as you actually know how to apply it. And so our goal today is we're going to be talking about using supportive resistance with ATR to plan your risk to find trades. And the goal for us today is really to help you understand what does that look like in regards to supportive resistance. So we're going to talk today. You're going to learn about how to identify key supportive resistance zones, how to use ATR to find that risk and stop placement. And then how to combine both for better trade setups. So first you want to understand the supportive resistance, and so it sounds one of those kind of like basic things that we all learn when we first start trading or we come out of the master classes. We just should these terms thrown out, support resistance, horizontal support resistance. And that's a particular strategy. That's the strategy I use. That's the strategy that Bill uses. And that's probably most of the strategies that many of you guys do. But I just want to make sure from a sort of basic level, we really understand support our areas where price tends to stop falling. Now, one of the things you want to keep in mind when it comes to support is timeframe. And so one of the things that I see a lot of when I look at mentor mode for my students is they tend to want to get into these one minute trades where there is no support area or they're trying to create a support area, but it's very, very weak. The resistance area, that's where price tends to stop rising or it's going to be a rejection. Now, it's super, super important that you understand why these levels form from a psychology and order flow and liquidity. That's what these are forming. So you got to remember, the market is built on human behavior. If I hung out within it, you guys for 30 days, and I just sat back and I just watched your mannerisms, just from a psychology standpoint, I could tell you within a few days, your person who gets triggered really fast, your person who stays calm, your person who's just running around joyfully and happy, X, Y, and Z. I know your mannerisms of what time do you normally wake up? How do you drink your coffee? We are creatures of habit. Well, guess what? The market works in the same fashion. So if you just know where to identify these particular areas, then it really helps you know where to take those trades. Now, the biggest thing of all is those time frames, the longer the time frame or the higher the time for me should say, the stronger these levels are going to be. So once again, if you try to build something on a one minute time frame, it's just not going to hold as strong as you would do on a daily, for example. Touchable with supported resistance, you guys started, those are horizontal zones. OK, horizontal lines. That is what, if you guys have seen me live trade, if you've seen a build life trade, that is exactly what we do. So if you notice, Bill and I are taking the same exact trades, we're just getting in a little bit differently within that trade, but we're both using the horizontal levels as our strategy. That's what we use. Then you have the dynamic, right? Those are the moving averages. You're looking at your 9 and 21, or in my case, I use a 10 and a 30. Those are going to be, you know, how are you going to be moving along? So one of the best ways I'll give you a tip, one of the best ways when you're drawing at the supported resistance levels, if you do use moving averages, is you want to see where you're moving averages align to those levels. Because if you have a moving average that is sitting near those support resistant zones, well, that's going to give you a stronger area than just by itself having that level. Now, I don't encourage you necessarily to go out of your way to try to, you know, form, be looking at the moving average to form those levels. You have to understand where the levels are. But ultimately, you know, what I will do is I don't trade with moving averages on. But what I'll do is when I am setting up my charts and I'm setting my levels, once I'm done setting my institutional levels, what I will do is I will then turn on my moving averages and then see, does any of the levels that I have, right? Will they actually be supported by those moving averages that I have? The third one, psychological round numbers, especially when you're looking at NQ, ES, futures, SPX, these are all round numbers where the market just likes it. I mean, think about it for this way. If you were to work, if you were to start to work out today, and today is Wednesday, the 29th. If you were to start working out today, how many of you for the first time are going to work out today as a today? I'm just going to start. No, what is the first thing everybody says? I'm going to start on Monday, right? That's kind of like the normal pattern behavior. So most people, I mean, even think about when you go pump gas, you might say, oh, I'm not going to stop at 40 190. I'm going to go ahead and round that up to 42, right? It's a psychological number, round numbers, that the market uses. So you can look at that. And then you can look at fibs, right? Fib levels, prior highs, prior lows. Now, there's a specific way you want to use a fib. I don't necessarily use it every single time, especially when I'm driving my levels. I don't. Now, if I have a level that is too distant from one area to the other, then I will bring that in. And I'll give you an example. If the ATR shows me that it moves $1.50, but I have a, say, a $3 move, okay? Then that fib, I will draw it out to confirm where that middle area is for the building zone. So there's a very specific way to do it. You don't just want to throw a tool out there and then just kind of see, does the static one work with the dynamic, the psychological and fib levels. You don't want to throw everything out there in the kitchen sink and then just say, all right, well, nothing's really working. All right, so how do you identify the strong levels? Okay? Number one, you want to look for multiple touches with those rejections, okay? That's gonna be the easier way. Now, I teach the institutional levels, which varies ever so slightly on this. Now, what I do is, when I teach those, I'm looking, you know, teaching my students to look from right to left rather than left to right. Nonetheless, we end up in the same areas, just with a little bit more precision, same areas. Number two, you want to look at high volume zones, okay? Where has the market been? If you see a level of pivot high, a pivot low, where is that area and where does the volume tell you? Okay? If you're looking for a support area, can you get the volume area to show you that that is indeed a valence support area? And then of course, confluence with other indicators. That's the one I'm just talking about right now, moving averages, the screen right before that I showed you. That's how you want to be drawing those areas out, okay? And so if you just kind of look in front of the screen here, and I'll take you with my laser pointer for a second, okay? Let's just say, for example, you're looking for a, you know, a support area, right? You got some moving averages in this area, right? You got a resistance area, you can see, okay? Where these are, and this is like, okay, well, we got a pattern here from an institutional level and look what happens. It aligns with the actual moving averages. Now, you look over here, for example, you got a resistance area, here's a pattern, right? You got a resistance area, a zone in this area right here. So you want to look at the moving averages or whatever other RSI, CTM, squeeze, you know, MagDee, you can look at any of those. But one of the things that I caution you on, don't put a bunch of stuff on your screen, trying to confirm and confirm and confirm and confirm. It's almost like taking a trade. I've seen this before where a trader will get into the, will look to get into the trade. The setup is there and the trader is looking for confirmation. He gets the confirmation, he wants more confirmation. And by the time he actually decides he wants to get in, it now reversed on him. But you have enough confirmation with the first one. And so that's what you want to think about when you're drawing up the strong support levels as you want to understand, you know, once you draw them out, then you could turn on those areas of confluence to further support that. And then you'll see over here, I have stronger levels, better stop placement, okay? The idea behind trading is you want, especially when options trading on lower time frames. You want to be able to know, hey, I'm willing to get into the trade here, but I also know where to get out, okay? And be willing to bail out when you have to bail out from there. So let's intro this to ATR, average true range. ATR, it measures the volatility. It gives you a sense of how much a stock moves per candle, per day or per session. So for example, if you're looking at a 15 minute timeframe, I know I have a general idea of how much I will move within a 15 minute timeframe to allow my trade to play out. Is it reasonable? Is it reasonable? For me to go from a support area of 100, all the way to the resistance area of 110 on a 15 minute, is that reasonable to do that on IWM? Probably not. How do I confirm that? I'll utilize the ATR to help me identify that from a larger timeframe, or excuse me, from a 15 minute timeframe. Now, as it pertains to your levels, your strong supporter resistance levels, since you're looking at a daily of four hour and a one hour, is it reasonable to see that in one hour, price will travel that distance from support to resistance within that timeframe. The ATR will tell you that, okay? And then you're using this to avoid placing stops to type. I mean, think about how many times we've all been there. The trade goes into the ticker, about two ticks in, we've put it into the green, it wicks us out, and then all of a sudden it skyrockets for like an 80% win. And we're all sitting there wondering what happened, okay? And then what happens on the flip side, we take this trade, and then we're like, you know what, this time around, I'm not gonna get out. It's two ticks in, I'm not gonna get out. And it's like the market maker knows what we're thinking. And eventually what happens is it doesn't go up any further. It actually goes down 15 ticks and you're like, oh boy, I'm now down. Well, the ATR helps you identify this part of it from a stop loss as well. So you can leverage this. Now, for those of you, little side note, for those of you who maybe are having a little bit of challenge with drawing at your levels, there is a video out on, I think it's on the tool, education or the tools on Discord. And you'll find a video that I created a while back before I started teaching institutional levels I was using, I created an ATR objective way of doing things. And I used that for a while before I learned how to do institutional levels. And so if you are having any issues or anything like that, you can certainly look at that and watch that. That'll help you find enough on your support and resistance levels. All right, let's talk about using your ATR to place your stops, okay? The HR, it's gonna help define a logical stop distance. Here's the thing, I'm gonna tell you right now. If you have not set up a CEST, if you have not set up, where am I going to get out of the trade if I'm wrong? If you have no idea, you should not be taking a trade, plain and simple. Okay, Alberto, can you describe the acronym, CEST, for those that are new? Yep, yep, CEST, the C stands for conditions. What are your conditions to get into the trade? The E stands for your entry. Where are you gonna enter? Are you gonna enter at the money, in the money, out of the money? Are you gonna enter at 242.02 when the stock price gets there, that's where you're gonna trigger your option? And then what's your stop loss? That's the S. And then the T is your profit target. You don't just get into the trade and you just kind of let it fly by the wayside and say, all right, well, let's see what happens from here. So that's what CEST is. Perfect, all right? So ATR is gonna help us define a logical stop distance. What's again, the biggest part to this, you guys, is if you're getting into a trade and you have no idea where you're gonna get out of the trade. I'm gonna tell you right now, your emotions are so strong. As psychologically speaking, you'll say, you'll convince yourself and justify yourself to say, okay, you know what, I'm down a little bit. I'm gonna let it see if it's gonna come back up. I'm gonna check it out. I'm gonna give it a little bit more. I'm gonna give it a little bit more. Before you know it, you go down this rabbit hole where all of a sudden you're down 50%, 80%, you're like, oh boy, that's why I wouldn't just got out. I've had this conversation many times with my mentees where I look at their trade zilla under the mentor mode and I'm watching and I'm looking at their trade and I put some notes in there for them and then I DM them and say, hey, look at the notes I just wrote. And I'm wondering why somebody took a trade beyond a certain percentage, right? And so it's understanding ahead of time. So the common method, right, is your stop equals your entry. So you're gonna basically look at whatever that entry is, all right, you're gonna add or subtract, you're gonna add or subtract this ATR, all right? So in this case, you'd see at the screen here, you're gonna entry, let's say you wanna go calls and let's say your ATR is, let's just say, you know, 10 cents, all right? So then you enter at, you know, 240 and then you would just subtract the ATR from there so that you can get to what your distance is gonna be, okay? Because what we're saying is on that time from that you're looking at, you could potentially take the trade to the downside before it pushes back up, that's a way to do it, okay? And then it keeps the stops outside the market noises. So I know I get a lot of questions around, okay, well, this is happening with the news and, you know, and one of the things for me that I have learned early on, it becomes very, very difficult, not to draw bias when I've got all the noise around me. And so I rather just stay on the charts, look at the charts, and you know, if I get into the trade in my zone and the news drives it, even better for me, right? But this is what the ATR is gonna give you. It's gonna give you basically an objective way to look at things so you can protect yourself, all right? Now, one thing little side note I will tell you is when it comes to your stop loss, personally speaking, I use a mental stop loss, so I know I'm gonna get out of the trade on the candle clothes. So if you do use this methodology to set up your stop loss, then you're gonna wanna make sure you pay attention to that particular area. Hey, Alberto, two quick clarifying questions. One, let's talk about the ATR. So first part of that question is where do you find it? And then the second part of that question is, is it displayed on multiple time frames? So do you have the ATR on a five minute, a 15, a one hour, or is it just the ATR for the entire day? And then you're calculating what would be a five minute move, first stop loss, 15 minute, so on and so forth. Great question. So the first question is to find out, you're gonna go under trading view, under indicators, and just type in average true range. The second question, it'll actually give it to you on any time frame you want. So as it pertains to support resistance levels that we're discussing right now, okay? You can find those on the daily four hour or one hour. When it comes to your trading, you can actually do use the ATR and it will give it to you on a one minute, five minute. It'll give you on that particular session timeframe that you're looking for. It will give you what that average move is within that time frame. And then which is your preference to look at? Five minute, 15 minute. Yeah, I like to look at a higher time frame. So if I'm trading before 8.30 in the morning, specifically, standing time, I'm gonna be looking at the one minute and the five minute. And if I'm looking at after 8.30 in the morning, I'm generally looking at the five in the 15 minute. Perfect, thank you. Great question, guys. All right, so combining support and resistance with the ATR, all right? Firstly, what we're gonna do is you're gonna find your supporter resistance zone first. Remember, that is gonna be a couple of different ways you can look at it, whether it is multiple touch points, whether you follow the ATR objective level video that I did back when I created that or whether you do it now with me on the institutional levels that I teach, okay? The second thing, you're gonna use the ATR to determine how far outside of the zone your stop should be. So let's just say that you find your level on a high time frame, add 100, and then you come down to a five minute time frame, saying I'm gonna get into a trade in this particular area. I'm gonna set up my CESC. So what were the ATR be for you? Should you get into that move on a five minute time frame? What would be the ATR on that five minute session? So then you were, let's just say you're gonna go cause, you would then take the level minus the ATR, and that's gonna give you what would be a potential stop area, okay? You wanna use that with confluence, right? How to hire probability and logical risk definition. So again, one of the things that I see a lot of folks who is one or two things, number one, they use way too much confluence, way too much, or number two, they don't use any confluence. And so you really wanna be able to have some kind of confluence. Now, I will tell you personally speaking, I use one, maybe two methods to use confluence, but I don't have like six or seven of them, right? And one thing I wanna remind you guys all, confluence you guys is various. So for example, my confluence will look at, I'm trading with candle patterns and I'm looking at horizontal levels. And then I might be looking at volume if I'm looking for a move to the upside. Maybe if I'm looking for a move to the downside, I'm looking at the TTM squeeze, okay? I know Bill will look at VIX and ES and he's looking at combining that with Spire QQ. So confluence you guys, it varies. It's not just stay on, just look at futures or just look at volume or just look at the map V. You gotta understand like what works for your brain to make sense when you combine it together. But you do wanna use some form of confluence in order to create a higher probability and also a logical risk definition. Does it make sense for me to get out? If I'm gonna get in at 100, does it make sense for me to get out, that's at 95 on a five minute time. Well, that's a five dollar move. Does it make sense on IWM? Well, that's probably gonna be a hefty loss if you're doing that, right? So instead of guessing, then you could set that up with your HR a little bit easier. So Alberto, you made the comment that some people use too much. What does too much look like? Yeah, so too much. This is for me, personally is going to be, if I'm using for me is anything beyond four, four confluences. So for example, if I'm watching price action, my first one is gonna be horizontal lines, right? The institutional level is that number one. I'm looking at volume at number two. And then I'm either gonna look at a TTM squeeze or an RSI, that's my three. That's all I use. For me, anything beyond that is gonna be too much. I cannot combine that for each one of you, that's going to vary. It might make sense for you to add something else to you, but I would just tell you, from a personal standpoint for me, anything beyond three to four, it's gonna be too much for me. Perfect, all right. Let's combine support and resistance with the ATR, live or statistics. We're gonna look at support and resistance drawn on a higher tire frame. We're gonna talk about ATR used to calculate that ideal stop and an example of a confluence set on. So let's take a look at this Apple and Daily chart, support and resistance with ATR and a base stop. So we're gonna say that the entry is gonna be at 255.02. All right, a trend line is gonna support that. We're gonna look at the support zone, which is a trend line. Now, let me stop right here real quick, just to kind of share with you guys another thing. Whether you're looking at a trend line, whether you're looking at a fib or something, that sort. Okay, this kind of goes back to that confluence set on, right? As you have an area of interest, you've got a trend line that supports that. You've got your moving averages that support that, but then you're still looking for more things to add to support that. The problem is when you go be on a certain amount of, of confluence, if you will, then what starts to really happen is you start to kind of get cross, cross analysis, where you kind of get a paralysis by analysis. And so remember, if you have a trend line, if you have your support levels, if you're got it, you're moving averages, RSI, whatever it is that you use. And those errors are supporting one another, great, then you're good to go. And let's say say that ATR. Now, you notice I have a 14 there, and that's because the average to range, I don't encourage you to change the setting when you go into trading view and you change it. On the settings, I don't encourage you to change it at all. Leave it at 14, because that's the standard that it's going to look for over the last 14 sessions. Now, those 14 sessions are going to be whatever time they're looking at. So if you're looking at a one hour timeframe, you're going to be looking at the last 14 minutes. If you're looking at a daily timeframe, you're looking at the last 14 days. So it's going to be based on those sessions. So in this case, we're going to say that the ATR is a $4.64, $4.64 move. A stop would be set at the 253 ADA, so we would take the entry and minus the one time ATR. Our target would be 26934, based on the start of the trend line to a key level. And then the risk to reward you're going to see is going to be about 1 to a little bit over 2.4. So this is what this would look like. Same exact thing I was just sharing with you. You notice here, let me take you here with the laser pointer. You notice here, you've got the area, you've got a window here, and you got a nice little trend line, a 45 degree trend line that's happening. So you take the trend starts right here. So you would take this area right here from bottom to top, and then you would just move it over here. That would give me the price target. My ATR would give me, I'm going to take the previous day close. And then what I'm going to do is I put an advocacy, really should be subtract on our ATR. And then this is for the up here, sorry. And what we're going to do is down here, this would be our stop loss based on the ATR. So if you get into the trade here, you see that you got a risk of worth 1 to 2.4. And then your stop loss would be down here. Now, if you notice where Apple was at today, it's like 260 something, I forgot where it's jumped into right now. So it came back for a moment, and then just put it all the way back up. This wedge is your confluent setup. You see that this is pushing and pushing and pushing. And then remember, Eric Dien has got to pop at some point. And so when it squeezes all the way through, it will just pop from here. So for your ATR, Alberto, are you doing it, calculating it on real time hours or extended trading hours? Yeah, everything I do from a charting standpoint is always going to be on regular trading hours. But you can look at this, OK? Again, this is all going to depend on how you're going to be charting. But you can look at this from the ATR standpoint of extended hours, but you've got to make sure that you understand that is the move you're looking through the lens of extended hours. All right. OK. So we're looking at position sizing with risk defined. So once the stop distance is defined, we calculate our position. We calculate our position size. I'll give you one second. There you go. Sorry, guys. That was my trading view alert that we know. OK, I'll trade that one off. OK, sorry. So the risk per trade equals percent of capital. All right. Then we're going to add our size, which is going to be our risk. OK. And we're going to take our entry minus our stop. That's how we're going to get the size of what we're doing. OK. So it's no guessing it's all math. Now, one of the things that you'll hear a lot, Bill shared this with me early, early, early on. And that is he shared with me. Alberto, one of the things about trading, there's an art. It's not a science. And so I was like, OK, well, how does that work? Because I know everybody wants kind of a black and white. So this is going to help you a little bit more on that side of things. But one of the things that we'll tell you where the art really, and you will not, I'm telling you right now, you will not be able to do it from a science standpoint, is just kind of how the entry itself, where it takes place. I get a lot of questions on, is it the one minute, is it the five minute, how does that look like? There's an art to that. OK. But from a set up standpoint, position your sizing, you can define all that stuff using the ATR. All right. Some common mistakes to avoid. Number one, ignore the ATR and place in an arbitrary stop. You're going to make a huge mistake if you get into a trade, and you don't know where your actual stop is going to be. You're just gambling for that matter. Forcing trades near weak levels. Now, I get this question a lot. Well, how do you know if it's a stronger or weak level? Well, a couple of ways. Number one, a weak level is basically we're on a lower time frame. That's a simple as that. So if you're trying to draw a level on a five minute time frame, that's going to be a much weaker level. Now, compared to a daily. So just from a time frame standpoint, that's the easy one. The other one, that's a little bit more finessing. To that pattern that I have. If you look at, for example, when Bill looks at it, on the extended hours, he's got that area where that price continues to touch within that range of where he's at. So we're looking in those areas. If you don't have something there, like all time highs, what makes it incredibly weak is you have no data. There's zero levels, zero information there. And then another mistake that we want to avoid is risking too much without calculating your size. I have learned by way of Bill and Bill has said this over and over and over. That trades, not our trade, our creating equal. And I stand behind that 1,000%. There are times where I will scale into a position. On a, you know, I will start a small position. There are times where I will go full positions. There are times where I don't go with full positions at all. I don't scale in, but I just go with a small position. And so all of that has to do with understanding where you are in relation to those levels. That is why the more precise you are with your levels, the greater the advantage you have in order to be able to take a train successfully. So let's talk about traders psychology on the discipline. Okay. So when you define the risk in advance, you trade with less fear. Think about this. How many times have you entered a trade? Okay. Because the market all of a sudden rips. Or in the case right now, what my trading view alert went off on me. And it tells me that some level or something just got triggered. Like, I'm not stopping with what I'm doing with you guys to go take a trade or go do some of that. It's just these errors of interest that I have where things get triggered. And my CES set up. So if I hang up the call with you guys right now, and I go to where this alert just notified me, there's no guesswork. My risk to the word is already set up. I already know where the trade is going to take place. And then I'm just looking for a nice defined entry. And if I'm wrong, I know where to get out. Okay. That's taking to point number two. No one where you are wrong gives you clarity. Okay. Now, the biggest part that I have to learn after I blew my account 75% after I blew that, the biggest part that I have to learn was being okay with being wrong. That was very hard because when you're taking some trades and you're wrong, you kind of think like, I don't know what I'm doing. And that's not necessarily the case. Now, there's some stuff to learn from that. Maybe was it a technical analysis? Was it a psychology? Did you get into the trade a little bit too high, too low? That kind of thing. There's something to learn from it, of course. But overall, the traders that can accept that they're wrong and bail out of a trade, those are the traders that live to play another day. Hey, O'Bourgh. So do you ever get out of a trade before the ATR stop loss hits? I will. Again, that's part of the art behind it, right? Like I will because maybe I got into the trade a little too high. And so I'm watching the level along with that ATR. So my level minus that ATR or plus that HR is going to give me the defined area. But it really is going to defend. Did I get into the trade a little bit too high, still well within my risk to reward? But I might have got into the trade a little bit high. So will I do it? It will depend on the trade. Do I tend to stick to making sure I get those candle closes? Yeah, I would say more often than not, you're going to find that I'm going to get out of the trade only on the counter close. Okay. So two questions. One in the example that you just showed, it showed an entry below a price level. So that would be higher risk, correct? I mean, that you might not break the price level. So there you might not want to sit around and wait for the stop loss significantly lower to trigger. Is that a fair statement? That is a very fair statement. And I will tell you one of the things that you want to look at these things remember, I'm giving you a broad look on how to use your ATR. So whether you're doing like say a one day, one DTE because you're looking for a possible breakout. That's kind of a momentum trade. Like there's another analyst who lives momentum breakouts. So you get into the trade ahead of time looking for that particular breakout with that destination. But yeah, that is a fair statement. Okay. That makes sense from that perspective. Okay. No more questions. All right. Okay. So no where you are wrong gives 30. Half to half to half to have to have to have to be okay with being wrong if you are wrong. Okay. So this removes an emotional decisions mid trade. I mean, how many of you guys myself included? How many of you know, we've all been there where you're in a trade and you're like, oh man, do I stay in? Do I stay out? And you're kind of like sort of, you know, holding onto your chair like when I really hope, I really hope I really hope it goes further further further. And then you get a slight pullback and you're like, oh man, I'm just going to get on the straight. Only to see it kind of go, you know, up further. So that's the whole idea. Remember a lot of a lot of folks, myself included, who have, you know, busted some accounts. A lot of it has to do because of psychology. You don't set up things ahead of time. You're kind of not really understanding where you are in your trade. And then what happens is you're sort of trading more emotionally rather than in a more objective manner and what you're looking at. Here's a bull flag break out. Okay. So you'll see here, you get a strong trend going on here. You get a consolidation going sideways right here. And then you get the strong up trend continuing. Now, if you know anything about my box range, this would be very similar to that, right? But the box range is more of a horizontal support and us going to be a more of a horizontal that's in the accumulation phase. So this could be accumulated kind of in a bear flag and a bull flag this way. And pop when you get this way, right? So this is one of those things once again, if it's squeezing and you get into the trade here or here, something like that. It's the same way that I would trade the box today when I trade my box. I will enter in that accumulation area. Why? Because for me, I feel very comfortable and it's one of the best ways for me to enter a trade. Because when it pops, it really takes off. But you have to understand when you're entering those trades, what your risk position is. So it's not like I'm risking full position when I'm inside of that. If it happens to pop and I can't get in on a better, and it doesn't come back for me, while I'm already in that trade. But this area, it's squeezing, right? All these squeezing, this is a big, big, big air. So it's like a consolidation, go sideways. It's kind of just started going down and then it channels itself back up. So let's look at this from a test standpoint. Okay, we'll look at a four hour. All right, and a 15 minute multi time frame setup. We'll look at the four hour break above the 260. All right, we'll look at the 50 minute bull flag near the breakout zone. We'll look at the entry where the flag break out the target and then the risk to reward. For me, the risk to reward when I set it up on my tool, I'm looking for about a one to two or a little bit above one to two. If I'm setting up my risk reward ahead of time, like the night before, I'm usually wanting to put it up a little bit higher above one to two. Just because when I get into the trade, I know that I might have to give myself some wiggle room from there. Okay, and then we'll look at the ATR on the 15 minute where we're looking at a $2.50. That's going to be our stop for about $258.50. So you'll see here, there's that bull flag on test them. All right, you notice that we got this movement happening here. Here's that channel that's happening and then you get this breakout that goes on. This is the expansion of that same breakout. Okay, and what we're looking at is if you were to go and continue this trade now, this thing goes continue going higher. But notice where the breakout happens. Okay, and you can see if I'm looking at the 15 and I'm on the 15 minute ATR and I'm asking myself, is it reasonable to go from $255 to the breakout on my four hour level? Is it reasonable that I can get this breakout and go north for $4 on a test them? Is it reasonable? The ATR is going to tell me, is it reasonable to go there or at least, is it reasonable to go maybe midway? And then I can calculate, all right, it'll take me maybe 30 minutes together. That's fair enough, too. But you have some objectivity to tell you how long that direction is going to go into the trade of what you want. Bill, any questions on the chat? I think I've answered all of them as we have been going through. Would it be possible for you to flip and share your trading view if possible? If not, we could do a video later and just show how you would look at the ATR on the actual chart of a specific stock. Yeah, absolutely. Let me see how I can get out of this. Give me one second. Bear with me here. All right. So what you'll find on months, can you see my screen, can you see my screen bill? Yep. Thank you. Okay, perfect. Yep. So up here on indicators, you go here, you're going to type in average to range. You notice that I have that already favorite. You click it. Okay. Now, if you don't uncollapse this area up here, what happens is you can't see anything. Okay. So this needs to be uncollapsed. All right. And now if you notice, I put my cursor over here, keep your eyes down here to this area. And you'll notice that the ATR on the one hour or 4 QQ at the moment is $2. So that tells me that this move can go $2 in either direction. So if I'm going to take a composition, you see here, there's a rising window right there that it opened up with a window. So if I go into the rising window, I look to take a trade, I'm going to look to take the trade possibly $2. So what does that lead me? That leads me into around summer right here. Okay. Somewhere around this area. That's the move that I'll be looking for. Now, if you're dropping down, let's go to a daily time frame, you would do the same exact thing on collapse it. Notice that down here. Okay. So you can see this is an $8 move. Now, this is super important. And here's just a tip that I'll give you. One of the ways that I know whether or not I'm going to be trading this and creating a structure in the midway through the market open is this much. If in the pre market, this stock has jumped what the ATR would be, I understand that it's going to start to flat line, maybe push ever so slightly. Might even come back in balance, but to even consider and say this is this seems going to jump another eight bucks. That's not very likely. So I do pay attention to the ATR on the daily time frame. If in the pre market or if in the market open, I see that the stock has moved significantly now. Since I trade regular trading hours, I'm mostly looking at if it opens with the gap. If it opens with the gap, then I'm wondering to myself, all right, it opened with say, you know, a $4 gap. What is my ATR and where was the market in the pre market? Because if it already kind of gas and use itself, then there's not a whole lot of room that you're going to have. You're going to literally be playing back within that range on a pullback, maybe to go backwards at, you know, get into a level to come down. But you will be looking at the ATR from that standpoint. If we go to a 15 minute timeframe, it would be no different, right? So let's go here, bring this interview for you. Again, if you don't uncollapse it, nothing happens. So you go here. Now you need to be away from this ticker because if you go right here, this is telling you the ATR for that session. So you got to get away from this and you got to put your cursor on this side. So on a 15 minute, I see that the ATR is about 92 cents. So if I take a move here, then I'm looking for about a 92 set move. So I can essentially look to see what is that. And that's going to align with those levels that I'm talking about. You can see getting here. You'll be moving out here. But the question is, doesn't it make sense? Okay. If we enter here, you go to your 92 cents, stop us over here. Doesn't make sense. For me, that trade wouldn't make sense, getting in right here. Getting in here would make a lot more sense. So then yeah, I can move, you know, that those 92 cents or whatever the case would be that I'm going to be moving. Okay. The hell bill? Yeah. Do you care what the ATR was in the past? Ah, not really because I'm looking at the, you know, what I was looking for is I'm looking up front, you know, up here to kind of give me a range to remember. So I was already calculating for me where it was back here. And so since I'm trading what current price action is, I want to see what is the average move I'm going to be looking for. So I might have something over here where this is like, say, plain and instead of 92 cents, let's just say that this was at $1.50. Well, that's not going to be relevant to me up here where I'm trading in a current range of 92 cents. Makes perfectly good sense. So we're, let's go back and just show them again one more time. So the ATR is calculated on each candle, correct? That's correct. So it's calculated on each candle. If you hover over the candle, it's going to give you the ATR for that candle. If you get away from it and just put your cursor over here, you're going to, it's going to give you the overall average true range over the last 14 days or 14 sessions. I'm sorry. So you're just reading it on the red chart below. Is that fair? Yep. That is it. That's all I'm doing. Yep. Just trying to figure out exactly where you're at. Okay. Yep. Good, good, good. Other questions, guys. Other questions. Where do you find your risk to reward tool in trading deal? Yeah. Yep. So follow the left here. Let me look this way. Okay. So if you're over here, you start here. It's going to be one, two, three, four. You should find it right here on the fifth one. And so once you get there, all you're going to do is you're going to select here and you're going to see long and short position. And that's going to give you the long and short. So and then for your long short position that was created really for. Future traders, not options traders. Do you change any of the settings or any of the defaults? Good question. I actually do not change anything. So I do use this for like my equity positions. And so you are correct that it is not for options premiums. But I do use this in the same fashion because I'm still looking for this. So what I look for is let's say, for example, I'm looking to take this one to four move. I'm looking here and saying, okay, my entry needs to be at two thirty five. So tonight when the stock gets to two thirty five, six and nine, I'm going to go ahead and trigger my trade. And I'm going to go ahead and go in that direction. That's how I base, you know, where my. My entry is going to be. Perfect. Cool. Dimitri, he watches the ATR in a five minute time frame, not on a one minute. You can look at it. But it's really punitive. If anything, you know, I encourage you go out five minute, 15 minute, look at something on a higher time frame and then taking a trade, you know, directional bias. Now the ATR is both to the upside into the downside. Correct. That is correct. Yeah. I mean, so you don't know if it's going to go up or down, but it's going to tell you it's going to go up by a dollar. It's going to go down by a dollar. But you're more likely to be directionally correct if you're in support or you're going to be directionally correct if you are in supply. So, Alberto, when you're trading your box strategy, do you use the ATR there at all? Or not really? Yeah, I don't really use it at that point because at that point that my strategy is at my direction of how much I'm moving is my box. Right. Yeah, because you're in a consolidation zone and you're going to take that box range and multiplying above or multiplying it below. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Perfect. Cool. Other questions this morning, guys. Okay. If I could add one thing, build before any question that comes up. One of the things I will tell you, build just kind of a little bit to something that is kind of. I'll put her book my thought on this just to share with everybody. Because the ATR is going to give you the average shoe range, not necessary in direction. That's where your levels come into play. Right. Remember, this whole thing started, the whole webinar started on supporting resistance. So as we're drawing out those levels on high time frame and you see. All right, I'm going to take that previous day close and I'm going to add the ATR to the upside and to the downside. Okay, and one day I can move potentially here and here. That's what I'm looking for. Right. Well, you need to make sure that when you're into those trades and you are looking at a 15 minute. Remember, you should be entering your trade at one of these levels that you have. And then you're going to take the ATR to go to the next direction. That's going to give you a solid. A solid risk of a war so that you can take that. So don't just take the ATR and just assume that it means that you're going to go up or it just means it's going to go down. It's giving you the range to go in either direction. So you're going to use your levels to give you that directional move that you're looking for. Right. Just telling you it's going to move 50 cents in a day or a dollar a day or $3 a day. Could go up. Could go down. Right. It's just kind of you're sealing in your floor that you want to take into consideration. How can it go beyond it? Of course. Right. If there's a news event or there's a catalyst or right. It's just watching something like Nvidia, you know, over the last 24 hours. It is just rocket it higher. But that was off of news commentary and partnerships. Right. So there's things that will skew it in one direction or the other. Cool. All right, Alberto. I think we got all the questions answered. So as a reminder, two things. One, obviously, this is more technical, more in depth. Takes more time to learn. We're trying to introduce you to different ways of thinking about liquidity, price structure, institutional level. So Alberto does work with people one on one. I know many of you have reached out to me. I am only doing one on ones with the master class pro students. And all the pro students are also going through this more in depth with Alberto as well. So one of the added features. But if you want to do a session or two sessions with him directly, just send him a DM in discord. And you guys can get something scheduled. But we're trying to really broaden the ways to trade the technical aspect of it. But clearly, you know, that this is a balance between art and science. But there is a science behind what we do. And then the art position is managing the emotional intelligence more so than anything. So I think we're good on questions, Alberto. I will again, it's recording. And I will upload it into the discord. And as always, my friend, super grateful for all that you do for not only me, but the other 1130 people in the community. So well done. Appreciate you guys. Thank you, Bill. All right, guys. Gus will be trading live for FOMC, which will probably be around 11 o'clock once the news announcement comes out. So I'll probably jump on with Gus and see what he has to say in some of his shareings. But always remember, trading during FOMC is pretty much a lot. And it is more gambling than technical analysis because the algorithms can read the newsfeed and the commentary a million times faster than any of us humans. And by then, it's too late. So with that guys, have a phenomenal day. And I think Alberto, you're on tomorrow morning for live trading where we'll put this into practice. Yep. We'll see you guys out tomorrow. All right, guys. Have a great one. Take care. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
