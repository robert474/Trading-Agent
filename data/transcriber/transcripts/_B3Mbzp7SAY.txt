 Welcome back everybody. So this is going to be the watchlist for Monday, December 15th. Hard to believe that we only have two more weeks left in the year and we'll be ringing in 2026. But let's go ahead and start with the economic report and what's coming out this week. So Monday is going to be fairly light. The only thing maybe to keep an eye on is what's happening with the home builder confidence index. Obviously the number of units that are going on the market is increasing but we are not seeing a tremendous amount of buyers coming in and absorbing up the actual supply. And a lot of that has to do with interest rates right is interest rates stay north of you know six and a half percent however six and a half seven percent. People are not willing to actually pay top dollar to get into a house with a fairly hefty mortgage payment right. But then also thinking about the cost of insurance and insurance has been going through the roof over the last three to five years and I don't foresee that stopping anytime soon. So keep an eye on that the Empire State Manufacturing Survey that's not going to be a real headliner so I don't think we have anything to worry about there. Big numbers on Tuesday the employment report okay this is also going to be the unemployment rate unemployment rate keeps ticking higher. So more people are out of work and staying out of work and then we're also going to want to watch what's happening with US hourly wages. Not only current but also year over year and then we have retail sales that's a delayed report from when the government was shut down. We have the sales minus autos and then we have PMI okay so these are going to be some big numbers that we're going to have to keep an eye on on Tuesday because the market will already be open. So let's let's not lose sight of that Wednesday nothing much some Fed governor speak I wouldn't worry about that Thursday is going to be another big number day. We have jobless claims we're going to have consumer price index. So what's going on with inflation is it coming down is the administration says that it is going. I don't even want to comment record lows. I think I heard that the administration said that gas is now a dollar 99 and three states. I'd love to know what those three states are because it surely isn't any state that I've been to or I've seen. So I think the rhetoric out there that inflation is not an issue. I don't think the consumers thinking that what's the weather and I think inflation is still probably going to be heading higher as tariff sit in place. And then Friday existing home sales kind of talked about that you know we have a lot of inventory homes aren't really moving. A lot of people starting to take homes off the market because now we're around that holiday season and then we'll see what happens with the spring buying and then consumer sentiment. Right. So this is going to be how does the actual consumer feel about the overall economy. And this has been hitting lower lows. Right. So now we're at about 53.8. That's that's pretty darn low right. The consumer is not feeling good about cost of housing inflation and especially groceries. So let's take a look at some of the charts. We had the FOMC meeting this week on Wednesday market took that news and rallied all the way up until we got to obviously Thursday. And then we saw precipitous sell down Friday. We got a little bit of a bid and then they started to sell it off. So the trend of the market is still on a higher time frame going to be you know starting to roll over to the downside. Right. So we got the nine crossing down. We got the curling of the 21 coming lower. But we really need to see if we're going to hold these levels here in spy of 682 and 680. If not, I definitely think that we can get further push down in the market. So these are going to be the price levels you're going to want to trade again. 686 79 also make sure that you are doing all of your charting on the futures. So for me and the futures data is going to be way more relevant or a heavier waiting than price levels and spy. So you can see here right. Once we close below on a five minute candle. This is actually a 15. But if I were to look at the five it did the same thing. We pushed lower right and then they can't get the candles to close below 6812. So these are the price levels that you want to shoot against right 6836 to actually go long with calls. Stay below we're going to look for puts will look for calls down here. It's 6812 to go up break below this to go down to 6800. Let's take a look at QQQ. Same exact thing here, you know, kind of following tech has actually been weaker than the broader market. What's been holding up the broader market has been the financials. So the banks are now trading at all time highs. The XLF is at an all time high. A lot of individual names JP Morgan Chase Wells Fargo right. A city bank big money center banks holdman sacks all time highs. So we'll need to see if that broadening continues. Or if we start to get a pullback and that's what will let spy come down. But you can see clearly that tech is weaker. So 612 44 is my level that we need to hold. If not, I'd be looking for puts again. Same story futures data super, super important with the cues. You'll see exactly they did the same thing right. We can't get back above this 25 to 54. We had an interim level that they were consolidating and holding and then we move back lower come up. Use this is resistant. So anything below 25 170. I think we have an opportunity to move all way back down here to 25 036 and potentially lower. So again, we're going to have a fair amount of overall demand. But it's at a low level. So you can see that this is only one hour 45 minutes two hours 30 minutes. One hour we don't get to the higher time frame until all the way down here at four hour. So just because there's buyers doesn't mean those buyers are going to stick around. If we get aggressive heavy selling. Okay, so make sure you are charting your yes and Q and also your volatility. I mean, if you are not charting VIX, you are missing out significantly, right? So volatility is still coming down, which means the market could grind higher. But when I look at these price levels, you can see pretty much to the penny come down, push up to the penny, push down, to the penny, push down, right? You have to be using price levels with volatility to decide which directional bias is the market going to be heading. Let's take a look at a bunch of individual names. So I'm going to go through these fairly fast because not really any of the price levels have changed. But you can see here with Apple, we keep holding this 277. I mean, you could have taken multiple trades over the last several days, probably several weeks, right? Every time we come here, huge rally up, come down, huge rally up, right? They do break below it a couple times. But look at this consolidation here, right? And so the bias is always to the upside, not to the downside. And as soon as they get below it, what do they do? They wick it right back up. Okay, so do watch Apple. If you want to throw an interim price level in here, I'd probably be somewhere right around here, okay, at 279.20 to really say, okay, is it safe for calls? And that's what my blue lines are, our shorter term interim levels within the current past five days. So get Amazon, Amazon's another great one, right? Keeps bouncing off this 225.18. We came down here and we got a bounce higher earlier on Tuesday, the ninth. We came down here, literally bounce higher. So watch these price levels and how they observe them. I mean, it is super telltale that if you take calls above, you're going to be pretty good or puts below. So you can see there's buyers. We get below 225. Guys, I think we're going down to 222. Now, you might hit some resistance right here as you start to touch the one month demand at 223. But I still think it's a good put trade, right? But first, I'd be looking for a call trade. Bounce here, go up, break below, retest, head lower. Let's take a look at Microsoft. This one's been fairly weak. Kind of trading right along with a lot of the chip names, obviously, with their investment in in video. But we're just chopping between these ranges here for 76 and 480. So I don't see a lot of play on this one unless you get below for 76, right? Weatness, take it down to 473 and change. Let's look at Google. This one coming off all time highs. We are now entering in the daily gap. Okay. So I need to now readjust my gap. My candle low on this one is 305 57. So let's go ahead and fix the top range to 305 57. That will fix that. We'll save it. And now we have a new gap to shoot for. But right now, directionally, this is somewhat heading lower on overall weakness. Okay. Price levels on this one. Not a big fan of really trading this per se. Let me just see if I can grab you another good level that I would definitely pay attention to. This is probably going to be more of a and we can go ahead and this was a heavy pivot that they really push this higher. So for me, what I would want to watch. And again, let's take this down to a lower time frame. How do they observe this 30923? We don't have a lot of supply here. So we're kind of right 5050. We have some buyers here. We have some sellers up here. And now we have a price level in between. But if you can get above 309 56 with some strength, then possibly back up to this 319 level. If we hold below this right in the market turns week, look for the gap fill. And then we break below 303, then 299 15. So I think those are some really good price levels that you could trade against with Google. Tesla has been all over the board. Every time I look at this thing, I'm like, what in the hell are they doing? They're buying it heavy and then they're selling it heavy. Lots of volatility back and forth. These prior highs appear at 474. All time highs are closer to 500. All in all, they are just keeping this in a fairly tight range between 439 up to 459. Now, when these contracts move as fast as they do and for as expensive as they are, you could easily get chopped up in all this craziness, right? But here was a, you know, fairly decent sell on Friday and then a recovery into the end of the day, a little bit of a dip and then the dip buyer. So they're back above 459. I think you could trade against that, which was this prior pivot here and then take it up to this pivot high to break supply up into 466. Oh, it's a good meta. Meta, this one's been weak. So this one, you know, had a good decent gap higher and now we are back selling this thing off. So we are below 647. They did get above it for a period of time over the last several days and then more weakness, right? Back to, are they over investing in AI? It is the spend just too much, okay? So you can see where we had the big drop back here after earnings, okay? And then we moved higher. We did have this gap up here that was left in the market and now we're kind of rolling over. So I do like calls here, though, at 636. 96. You can see, they really respected that level back here on Thursday, the fourth. So about what, 10 days ago, right? Nice rally to the upside, but do wait for us to come down to here to grab your put position. If we push up here to 647, I think you can safely take puts, right? And just know you've got to close them above, but just I don't like how they consolidate this like this for hours on end, right? Where they're up to liquidity, they come down and they chop around and they come down and they push it up and they come down and they push it up, right? We're not getting a clear directional bias. So be a little bit more careful on meta if you're going to trade that one. Let me go ahead and save that. In video, relative weakness, especially on Friday, right? And this was because of Broadcom, and I'm going to look at Broadcom next. But if we break 174, I definitely think you can do puts down here to 171. Look at this wick here. So really, you're going to have to say, do I take profits at 173? Or are they going to wick me on this to take it back higher, right? And so you can see right here, same exact price level. They wicked it up pretty hard here. They wicked it up pretty hard. So this is on a very low time frame being 15 minutes. So you're going to have to watch the market breath to see what that does. Speaking of Broadcom, let's go ahead and jump into that one real quick. Left a huge gap up here after earnings. This stock is on a year-to-date basis. I mean, is up insane amounts. I mean, so let's go back here to, let's see, 2025, January, right? We were here at 250. It's trading at 350. I mean, the stock's up, you know, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent at these all-time highs. And there's almost 100 percent banger in the stock. So look for overall weakness. We'll use this candle wick low because I think it's relative from an overall price perspective to say if we get below this, I definitely think you could probably look for puts going back down to the gap fill. AMD has also been weak. This one, you know, was a good put trade that I saw some of you take on Friday, okay? And when the chips are weak, they usually sell off pretty significantly. Two, three, four, five percent. They're not, you know, a quarter here and a quarter there. So if we break below 209, definitely take this thing down to 203. Let's just check supply and demand. Yeah, not a lot guys, right? 30 minutes, 30 minutes. And then nothing till some real buyers down here at 201. So I do like, keep this one on your watch list. AMD for puts. That one looks good. Palantir, big wick buying on Friday down at the 50-fib level. So let me show you that on a higher time frame, okay? Where we got a really, really strong reaction off this 50-fib right here at 177, taking it all the way back up to 186. That was a big one, okay? So this, I would read this as relative strength. What I don't like, right, is we have sellers and we have buyers. They're pretty much on top of one another. But I do think you could trade against these levels of 184.61, right? That's the top of the 618 fib. But if they get above this, we're going to 187. And they get above this 187, then you can definitely take this all the way up to 192. So this is technically still bullish, not bearish. They pushed hard off the 55. They got it above 618. But you want to get above this price level to keep going higher, okay? Let's take a look at PTCU SD Bitcoin all over, right? Lots of volatility on this one. We're at 84, then we're at 90 something, and then we're back to 84 again, you know, just this whip lash back and forth. So let me zoom out on a daily basis, and you could kind of see where we're at on this one. Lots of oscillation between 8892, right? 8892. This is your trading window. Now we can add a few more price levels to say if they get below this 87, then we're definitely probably going to be coming down here back to where we were able to hold and rebalance the market at 86, okay? So now while I'm not going to be trading Bitcoin, right? Or I wouldn't probably wouldn't trade the ETFs either, but I would definitely be trading micro strategy. The MSTR is a great proxy for Bitcoin. As we all know, it rejected off the 55 up here from this pivot high, okay? To this pivot low, where did it reject the 55? We came down, we used my prior price level as resistance. We are now heading lower. So the fib can now go away. Get rid of that. And if you break below 174.60 with some strength, definitely take this one short. Do note right here, we're going to use an interim price level on a 15 minute, which is also the same as a five, okay? We're going to keep this one blue so that we know that it's not a daily four hour or one hour, but you break below this and we're going to 166. This company is trash if you ask me, but I'm just going to leave it there. Let's go with hood. Another one, right? Proxy with Bitcoin. Looks like we moved into the gap fill on Friday. So this candle low real quick, 117.85. Let me go ahead and adjust my charts. 117.85. My gap is now smaller. The smaller the gap, the less it acts as a magnet, right? So the gap's now like a buck, okay? The market's not going to really care about closing a dollar gap, but it's when we got a $20 gap or a $30 gap or a $40 gap. I mean, that's monumental, but a dollar gap, not much, but we'll keep it here just to watch and see how price responds with the overall market. Now, we do have buyers below the gap, so that's where I would be careful. We do have sellers up here, okay? So I think if you push up to probably price level or VWOP, see how this opens. You can definitely take that one short again. I forgot about Oracle, just a mess, right? They're debt that they are issuing and their ability to repay that debt is what has the market, highly, highly concerned. We got a gap above and a gap below. My bias would be that this gap below is going to fill first. We don't have a lot of buyers. We don't have a lot of sellers. So this one, watch and see, does it hold the top of the gap or do we fill the gap, come back up, retest it and then push lower to fill it back down to the 180 price level. And then I'm just going to take a look at a couple retailers that are out there. So huge gap up on Lulu Lemon. This one, 208 is going to be this price level high, which was a prior pivot. If we push back up here, I definitely like puts, if they decide to sell this thing off, the CEO was stepping down. So they did do decent on earnings, okay? So they beat on earnings and they beat on revenue. But their forward guidance was awful. I mean, it just sucked. Now, the stock was down to 177, which is where I bought it in the past or 167, one of those two. And then I got out of the position as we started to head higher, did not hold it through earnings and that's okay. Okay, I got in at 161 down here. I knew it was in the 160s, 170s is where I got out. Now it's trading at 200. I don't think you hold this thing. I think if you're in it, take profits and be done with it. Nothing sexy about holding these retailers. You can see the same thing with Nike. And I'm going to show you one more, I'm going to show you two more. So Nike, same exact thing, right? It gets some news. We're getting a new CEO, you know, push it all the way up and then what do they do? Sell it all the way down. So if Nike falls below 6593, definitely you could probably look at taking some puts. I like puts up here better at 6943 to go lower. And I do like calls down here at 59 bucks, right? We break 59 bucks. You have one month demand, which is going to be really hard to eat into. But if you get down to 52, then that's definitely where you pick up some more equity and you write it to the upside. But right now there's nothing fantastic. Home Depot bad earnings for like the last three overall reports, right? I mean, this is not good with earnings that they keep missing and then they guided lower. So let's get rid of the supply and demand. If you get above 362, I think you definitely take calls back up to 381. I don't necessarily like puts here. Why don't I like puts? Look at all the buyers, right? So I like calls if you get down here to 345. But I wouldn't short this thing. I'd be looking for a call trade here or a call trade here. And then the last one I'm going to look at that we'll go back to what I talked about in the master class is Starbucks, right? We are just consolidating for the longest period of time from September, October, November, and December in a range. So this is where you would consider doing an iron condor. Okay? So this is where you would sell an upside call spread. Now that we're getting to the top of the channel. And then when you come back down here to the bottom of the channel, you would sell a down side put spread. Okay? So you're collecting premium on the calls you're selling and then you're collecting premium on the puts knowing that it's just stuck in this channel for 90 days. Now you're going to have to be careful because we do have earnings here. But they're not coming up to February 3rd. And I don't know if there's going to be anything absolutely fantastic that happens at Starbucks between now and February 3rd. But I do like if you get into just a straight call trade calls above 86 puts below 82 and just ride the liquidity up to the next price level or down to the next price level. So with that everybody, it's everything I wanted to cover with you today. The good news is registration is now open for the January master class. So if you're interested, grab AC because I am going to raise the prices before January 1st. So the results that we are able to document and demonstrate are literally second to none. And the value of not only the class but the community, it fire out seeds exceeds what's currently being charged. So if you're interested get in there, grab a seat, get enrolled or if you know somebody, refer them over. I'd love to help them out on this journey, which is truly life changing when it's done correctly. As you know, when it's not done correctly, then it's just another form of gambling and that's what we don't want to be doing. So with that everybody, have a fantastic Sunday, Sunday and I will see you all tomorrow morning for live trading. Take care.
