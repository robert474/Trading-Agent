  "text": " Hey, I'm Bill Fanter, founder of Options Action, and you're watching the weekly watchlist. If you'd like to get access to this content before it goes live on YouTube, just hit the first link in the description to sign up for our free weekly emails. Alright, let's jump right in. Hey, welcome back everybody. This is going to be the watchlist for Monday, October 27th. So let's go ahead and start with the economic calendar now clearly because the US government is still on lockdown, I guess not lockdown, it's shut down. Same thing, right? Nothing's getting accomplished. We're not going to get a lot of the data that we want to see, although we did get CPI on Friday. Now here's the funny thing about CPI. It came in hotter than expected, but long term directional bias, it's getting closer to where the FOMC is targeting for inflation. Now however, it was 3% higher than it was a year ago. So things that you're seeing that are costing more, and I'm even noticing this myself in the grocery store, right? Coffee. Coffee's going through the roof. Meat's, especially beef, is going dramatically higher. Vegetables, fruits, I bought three apples the other day. This is crazy. Three apples, good size apples, right? Get to the register. $10. I almost told them to take the apples off my shopping cart. It was just thinking what in the hell is going on here? But that is what is happening with things that we import. Now we do have more news rhetoric between us in Canada due to a Ronald Reagan ad that ran around inflation that the president did not like. So we are now taking all negotiations with Canada, totally offline, and now we are assessing another 10% premium on the tariff's that are already there. So it's literally tit for tat, right? Who pissed in your sandbox? And it's just getting ridiculous nowadays from my perspective as a consumer, right? But let's go ahead and see what we can trade off from a news perspective. We are going to have the case-shiller home price index. So we are going to want to watch overall home prices. Now they have been coming down as inventory is starting to build. Yes, mortgage rates are coming lower down to around 6%. You can probably get a 30-year fixed five and three quarters, right? Pay a point, five and a half, somewhere in there, still decent. But the problem is everybody who owns a home is pretty much locked in somewhere between two and four percent. So do I want to get rid of my mortgage at three percent or two and seven eighths? I had two and five eighths was my last mortgage in California. And I'm like, well, I am not getting rid of two and five eighths unless I can go somewhere and pay cash, which is exactly what I did, right? Sold the house in California, made a ton of money, came to Vegas, cash, done, easy, no mortgage. But if you got to go out and get another mortgage on a million dollar home, and I know most people are like, what are you talking about a million dollar home? Where can you buy a home in this country in a major metropolitan area where you're not going to have a ridiculous commute for less than a million dollars? I just don't see it. Whether it's LA, New York, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, I mean, for Kranau, loud, home prices are not coming down. We're also going to have consumer confidence. And then what we'd love to see again is more economic data, which we are not going to get, but we are going to get the much anticipated FOMC rate decision on Wednesday. So Wednesday morning, we will not be trading live, but we will be doing a webinar for each of you in the discord that morning, probably right around 7 a.m. Pacific Standard time. So we're going to not trade that day because it makes zero sense. Options premiums are quite expensive. The market chops around and I promise you statistically. If you just keep trading every morning of FOMC, over time, you will lose 10 times more money than you will make. It is just a statistical fact. So we don't trade FOMC mornings. It makes no sense. Now, if you want to trade at the press conference or after the press conference, then that's another story, right? And that's probably more along the lines of power hour to see how the market digest the overall rate cut. Or do they hold steady? My guess is they are going to cut rates at least a quarter percent. And then what the market is going to want to know is do we have one more rate cut this year? Okay. Thursday, what we would love to see is jobless claims in GDP. We're not getting it. And then all the inflationary data, personal income, consumer spending, which is so important to understand should this market be staying at all time highs. Okay. Now, what's going to be dependent upon whether or not we get a correction that we're looking for? It's not probably going to be what the FOMC has to say, but it's going to be about earnings. Okay. We have a big week coming up ahead of us. So if you look, we have all of the heavy hitters we have on Wednesday, meta, Microsoft, alphabet, all after the bell. Okay. We also then on Thursday are going to have Amazon. We're going to have Apple. We're going to have Coinbase. This past week, we already had Tesla. We're going to take a look at the Tesla stock and kind of see how that responded. And then we're going to start to hear from the oil companies. But what I want you to keep in mind is that one third of the S&P 500 weighted index as to where prices are trading are due to the mag seven Microsoft, alphabet, Microsoft, meta, Amazon. These guys are holding up the entire stock market for not only SPY, but QQQ. So what is going to be interesting to listen to is going to be the capital spend. Okay. It's not going to be about the revenue. It's going to be are they going to keep pouring more and more money billions of dollars into AI and infrastructure. Now we're going to look at these stocks because they are not making new all time highs with the exception of alphabet and Apple. The other ones are still five to eight percent lower than their prior all time highs. So this is going to be a big week again. We got a full MCN Wednesday. We have a lot of tech earnings. So Thursday will probably give us a little bit better insight. Okay. Let's go ahead and take a look at some of the charts. So we're just going to look at the technical aspect. So this is by you can see we had a huge gap up on that CPI number on Friday, which again, to me, doesn't make a lot of sense when it's still not cooling dramatically. You're over here, but the market wanted to hear that with a Fed rate cut and it literally shot up higher. We do have a gap fill below that I'll keep an eye on other than that. I'm looking for a pull back to at least this 673 possibly the top of the gap fill. Okay. Now mind you, here's how liquidity works. And I want you to pay attention to this. If you saw what the gap was, right, this is what we're going to want to observe is the top of the gap going forward to see do they come down and bounce it or do they start to get into the gap, reject it and head lower and go for our prior all time high, which was this 673 94, which is where the market was consolidating ahead of the actual open. Okay. Let's go ahead and look at the cues. Same exact thing. This was a prior all time high 613 18. What did the market do with the pre market literally bounced off of it and before the bell could even ring? We created a gap. Now I was actually able to take a wonderful call position here on the bounce of the top of the gap. Now ironically that also lined up with guess what the orb. Okay. So if you're going to look at the opening range breakout, it is right here. This is the bottom of the orb. So we had again great strength. I didn't have an opportunity or want an opportunity to short the high, but again, don't fight the trend. Come down here by your calls and up we go. Okay. So we'll keep an eye on this as the week progresses, but right now 618 42 all the way down here to 615. I you could get an interim level maybe here to about 615 616. You know that you might want to keep an eye on, but for right now, I think just patience is key. Let me show you one other thing. So this would have been something else you could have done as well is just did the Fibri Tracement. Okay. On the pre market high and low and look at where the market bounced on the open at the 55 look where it bounced later in the morning at 755 AM, the 55. Okay. So use your fibs when you don't have a predetermined price level to trade off of. Let's go ahead and look at some of the big names. So let's go ahead and start with Apple again pushing up to the all time highs from prior in the week. So you could see where we're at. You know, it had a lot of relative strength. Good momentum to the upside right. We're just kind of holding right here. Now again, if I wanted to take an interim level, where would I look to want to buy? Probably right around here in this area 262. Now again, we are going to have earnings an ideal position to buy would be at the 55, which is down right at that 260 level. So if we can push down to 260, should be able to hold quite a bit of support, enable to move higher. And you can see we have a lot of buyers down here. So quite a bit of sellers up above. So this one again, I think you have to be patient, but the buy signal right down here, which I know USC Iceman took a trade on as did we during the life in his trade went up as he got into this trade and we stabilized. It was a 300% banger. And then note how it goes from liquidity level, pretty much to liquidity level. Right. So now what we want is we want a decent pullback to say, could we get an entry and then if I was going to do an interim level, probably somewhere right around here 262, right? This was the pre market high. They did a draw on liquidity right at the close and that would be something to keep your eye on. One more thing. If you want a little bit more confirmation to say, you know, a safer level would be back down here at 261. Okay. So just taking the pivot load to the pivot high within the daily and see how that reacts as well. So we'll go ahead and watch that for later in the week. And because this is an interim level for me, I'm going to change it from yellow to blue. Okay. We'll just watch and see how that gets observed. Let's go ahead and take a look at Amazon. Amazon again with everything else had a strong week this entire week for the most part. Right. We've got some good momentum Thursday going into Friday, rejecting this 225. But again, well off the all time highs of, you know, 242. So doing some consolidation right here within this range. Again, I'd want to see us get above 225 to go long. Don't necessarily like puts. You can see we have some interim demand forming right here, but we really have the sellers up here at 228. And again, a safer trade is go ahead and wait till you get above and hold that 225 level. Let's look at Microsoft. A lot of back and forth on this one, right. So we're back here to this 525 23 high, right. This was not the all time high. The all time high is all the way up here at 562 and change. Okay. So again, the market's making new all time highs, but this mag seven is not. So it's been a broadening of the market. So again, above 525, I think you're good for calls, possible bounce down here at this 522. You can see how they've been pulling liquidity a little bit lower on this one. So this is another great example of where I would kind of just watch and say, well, where would be a better entry and you can see it kind of right here, right. They keep getting down to this 522, but if they break these pivots and you go long, then that's where you would just want to stop out of the trade. But right now, we have a lot of sellers. We have quite a bit of buyers at 522, but I don't want to buy and go right into the sellers. I want to see sellers all the way up here. So this is one for me that I would just say, I'm just going to stay away from Google making new all time highs 261 68. Again, we did have a trend line here that they were able to hold. We didn't even get the retest. This is what I was watching for on Friday. Could I get a retested this to go long? I never got it. They did hold my 256 level. So that was decent. I'm going to go ahead and get rid of the trend line. And now we need to push above 261 68 in order to take some calls. But you'll note, right, we don't have many sellers up here because we're all time highs. A better buy is going to be at this 250. But mind you, again, they have earnings. And then there was a gust posted in the discord. And placed an insane put trade at the 250 level on alphabet. I mean, for the tens of millions of dollars in premium paid. So this one is going to be interesting to see how this plays out. Let's look at Tesla. Tesla did not have great earnings, which was ironic. And ultimately what happened, right, they missed, okay, was it very pretty? Nothing looked good. But they sold it off, off of earnings in the pre market. And then for whatever reason, they just bought it right back up, right? Elon Musk comes out and talks about the future future of robot taxis, future of robots. And they bought it up. And then what do they do? They sold right into it on Friday. Literally no momentum. So if you look at this stock on a four hour timeframe, it is literally just chopping back and forth in this range. Right here, back and forth, back and forth. Me, I'd like to see them come down here to this 398 level and fill this gap before they actually decide to make a move higher. Now we are making higher lows, okay, which is a plus with the exception of this candle right here. So again, I think just patience on this one, let them pull this thing back 10% down to 490 and change. And then I think it's a good long position. Let's go ahead and take a look at Nvidia. Nvidia is another intriguing one that again, it is struggling all week. It can't really get any momentum above this 187. We've just been oscillating back and forth between 180, 187. So we go up, we come down, we go up, we come down, we go up and they are not breaking through this. We need to see them break above this 187. 35, 188 to go back to potentially all time highs of 195, which was back here about two weeks ago, right. So it's not holding up and making new higher highs. We're getting a little bit of a pullback. Now watching it on a four hour time frame, right, we had a high, a lower high, we did not get a lower low. And now we are getting a higher high from this pivot. So watch for the reversal back to the upside. But again, a lot of it I think is going to be dependent upon FOMC as well as what is going on with big cap tech earnings. AMD making new all time highs. Again, we got a gap below. I like this buying this at, you know, 235. Ideally, you'd want to see a pullback all the way down here to 170. We're not getting that anytime soon. But then we do have a longer duration trend line, although we appear at 272. So if I go out to a daily timeframe, okay, and zoom out and look at this long term time frame, right. So it starts back here in 2021. We go then to 2024 and just following this higher, this thing has just been an insane ripper to the upside. We do have a couple of gaps, right. But the news has been so strong and look at this map. The, I mean, this is insane. Now again, they're going to have earnings, but not till the first week of November. So we got to wait a little bit longer here for AMD. This is one that I wouldn't trade. I don't think you need to trade it. Premiums are just too darn expensive. And I think there's just better opportunity elsewhere. So just my two cents. Let's take a look at Intel. Intel was interesting. It announced earnings ran up 7% in the after hours and then they just sold into it, right. I mean, they're like not having it. There was a gap fill up above. So you could have watched that to see was that going to fill and then push to 44, which was my next price level. They got it up to the gap fill and said, that's a no. We're all taking profits here. So that was kind of interesting to just watch that dichotomy. Do keep an eye on this. I think if you get back down here to this 37 range, 3710, you could take it for a bounce. We should have a lot of buyers here. Yeah, fair amount of buyers, right. But if we get below this, I don't know that I necessarily like puts. Again, this stock has been really strong to the upside. But seeing it do this off of earnings is not encouraging. Okay. So keep an eye on until 3710. Let's go ahead and take a look at meta. Meta is going to be another one that again kept struggling, right. Could not get above this 740 level. They get above fail, get above fail, get above fail, get above fail. Okay, we have a lot of sellers up here. The concern with meta has a lot to do with the fact of cash on balance. They had an insane billions and billions and billions of dollars of cash. Okay. Now, they are taking on an insurmountable amount of debt to build out AI. And that's why it is going to be so imperative to listen as to what is going to be the cap expend for these companies. And are they going to dial up back? So if they're not going to be buying chips and they're not going to be building out, you know, the semiconductor sector and they're not going to be building out AI is quickly is what they were anticipating because the debt load is building. These things are going to sell off. Okay. And then the entire market will obviously sell off with it. But the concerning thing, you know, to me again is, you know, they're pushing all the way up here in almost 800 and then just after a trickle down, it's been consolidating, right. Looks like it's ripe for a move higher, but we do have an awful lot of sellers up here. So keep that one on watch as well. Let's go ahead and take a look at PayPal. This one, I think there's an opportunity here for a potential break higher if we get above 70, 74. Again, they're going to have earnings this week on Tuesday. Okay. So this thing has just been, you know, beaten down for the longest time, right. This was one of those phenomenal COVID stocks that at an all time high, you know, was all the way up here at $300 a share, right. Now, we have just been, you know, kind of wandering aimlessly back here all the way from August until most recent off of overall consolidation. Now they did have earnings back here, right. They beat on both the top and bottom line, but the market didn't give it any love. Okay. And so this had to do with a lot of headwinds with international currency translations and how weak the US dollar is, right. They're a payment provider. They move money. So when the US dollar is weak, their business gets hurt. Okay. Don't know that I would necessarily short this, but look at this phenomenal consolidation in here. And it is going to move one way or the other. My bias would be to the upside, not necessarily further to the downside. And then again, we do have a lot of buyers sitting below. So should be interesting. Maybe do a little research on PayPal. I think that's one worth looking at. This is UPS. UPS is the other one that has just been doing this consolidating for the longest time, right. Come all the way back here to August. Same exact setup, right. These look very similar to one another where we are just in a range, in a range and a range. And then we need a catalyst. Now the problem with UPS is last quarter, it did not guide higher. And then again, it was struggling with overall revenue. A couple of things with UPS. They lost their biggest contract being Amazon, which was intentional from their perspective because the margins were so low. But then again, the tariffs that were impacting Chinese imports and imports from around the world does impact the overall packages that are moved, right. So therefore tariffs and seeing how it was impacting their business, huge, huge sell-off. But we do have a nice gap above. And this is part of the transport business and a really important component to the overall economy, no different than FedExes. But again, look at this right going all the way back here to COVID, right. I mean, crazy, right. This was a $226 stock that is 70% cheaper. And just because it's cheap doesn't mean that it's a buy. And then over time, again, remember we only chart gaps on the higher time frames, but you can see that we have a gap up here, right. We have a small gap right here right below the price level. But ideally, if this thing has bound a base, if you will. And we've been having good, mapped the buying traction, but just not enough to be a catalyst higher. So again, we do have earnings coming up. This one will be something to keep an eye on. And then quantum computing, right. I did take a trade on this one. Let's take a look at QBTS, right. Dewey quantum. Push this thing insanely, all the way up here to a 40-some box. Got a really good pullback down to 26, right. That's a 50% haircut. Caught a little bit of a bid on some rumors that the US government was going to start buying into quantum computing companies and take an equity stake of somewhere around 10%. I did catch a nice put trade on this once it fell below the price level of 3251, right. So this was the news on the White House potentially taking a stake in it. We got a good pullback. It gets another leg higher. But if we get below 3251, I think you can definitely try some puts. I would definitely be doing puts below 2918, okay. So we don't have any buyers here. And these things, you know, will just sell off super quick. Now, you also have to be very careful because the bid ask is really wide, okay. So when you're getting into these, you have to be very patient. And I would even consider placing a buy limit order, which I normally don't do. I normally do buy market, but the bid ask is super, super, super wide on these things. But when it pays, it pays exponentially. So those are kind of things that I'm watching this week. And for those of you that are in the discord, I will see you Monday morning for some live trading. Again, don't get your hopes up too much this week. Everybody's going to be watching tech earnings. Everybody's going to be watching what the FOMC says. The markets are at all time highs. It's okay not to take a trade. It's okay just to watch. You're not missing anything, okay. And protecting capital is the number one name of the game. So with that, everybody, have a phenomenal week ahead and happy Halloween. I hope you're going to go out and do something fun. And with that, I will see you all at the beginning of the trading session tomorrow. And if not, we'll catch up next weekend where we'll be able to look at how did each of these stocks respond. And we are going to enter the month of November. So happy Halloween, everybody. Take care. Thanks for watching.
