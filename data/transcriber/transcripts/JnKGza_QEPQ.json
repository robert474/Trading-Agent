  "text": " Okay, good morning, everybody. So Bill Fanta here and thanks for taking some time out on this Saturday morning to learn a little bit more about the program that you constantly see me talking about day after day. So I also want to introduce Elberto Perez, who was not only a great friend, but he was also a student about a year and three months ago if I'm not mistaken. Does that sound about right? Yeah, I guess the 2024. Good morning, everyone. Yeah, perfect. And then not only was he a former student, but now he's an analyst within the community calling out live trade. So when you're going to see what the power of this program is, I think you will be incredibly impressed. So today's format, I'm expecting the call, probably be about 30, 45 minutes. If you have to drop, I get it. Everything is recorded. I will send out the link as well as my free gift that I promised each and every one of you, which was a week of free access to the community to actually come watch us do this live. Right? And you'll see that I talk about that all the time. It's, you know, really hard to fake live trading. Okay? So let's go ahead and jump into the presentation. I'm going to talk about the program in the community, first and foremost. We're going to do some Q&A. So I got about 12 questions that just constantly come up all the time that people ask. So we'll get those out of the way. Then we will answer your questions that you have. So the chat is open. So you can type in the chat what questions you have. Alberto's going to kind of monitor those and help manage those with me. I'll answer some. He'll answer some. But I don't want to take all the lines off mute just because life happens in the background and we'll get crying babies and barking dogs and flushing toilets. And I think you guys probably would rather omit that because you get to deal with that in corporate America. And then finally, I'm going to take you through the discord. So we're going to take you live into the community. So you can see everything with full transparency, exactly how it works. And then again, this is being recorded. So if there's any issues, don't worry. I will get you the link. So with that, let's go ahead and get started here. So what I want to talk about really quick is a very fast disclaimer that I, as well as the community, this is not meant to be investment advice, tax advice, legal advice, investment advice, right? I will never ask you to trade your money. I will never reach out to you. None of the analysts will ever reach out to you. And all of the income and earnings that we're showing are live. They're legitimate. They're actual. Okay. Now, are you going to be able to replicate this? We'll see. I will tell you what makes very successful traders. And I will tell you what causes people to fail. And I guarantee you that you will hear the exact same words come out of Alberto's mouth that come out of mine, right? Because we've both been there, done it. And then we've coached hundreds if not thousands of people around what some of the deficiencies are. Okay. I already stated this, right? Every reference year, time stamped, recorded for visibility. Now, neither me, employees, subsidiaries, right? I'm not a financial advisor. I want to make sure you know I am not licensed. I teach. I educate. Again, I will never manage your money. I will never ask for your money. I will never offer a copy trading. I will never reach out to you. Nor will any of the other analysts. And no matter how many times I say this. I will always get someone that will say, hey, Bill, I got a DM from you. And I hear you have a copy trading program. And then how many times I have to say the answer is no. I do not. We will teach you how to fish. My goal is not to fish for you. Okay. If I wanted to do that, I'd go back into corporate America. I'd go get licensed as a banker. I would live a very miserable life being a servant to others, which I refuse to do, which is why I'm retired at 54 living the good life out here in Vegas. Okay. So all the information is here in your own risk, right? Take it for what it's worth. Ask questions. I will provide hundreds of references. Okay. Unequivocally. Full transparency. Nothing to hide. But at the end of the day, the success of this program and what we do relies upon you. So the winner in trading is because of you. The loser in trading is because of you. It is not because of anybody else in the quicker that you can stop looking to others to succeed. And you start looking within yourself. That is really where the magic happens. Okay. So let's talk really quick at a high level stocks versus options. And I just happen to pick a company called Chase. It's a bank here in the United States. It's the largest for all intents and purposes. And if I wanted to invest in Chase, I have a couple of opportunities. One, I could go buy the stock. Okay. I could buy a thousand shares of Chase, which was trading yesterday around $315.50. And it would cost me $315,000, right? Just to take a 1,000 share position. Now, if I wanted to control the same notional value of shares, I can do that with options for as little as $2,450. So I could just go out and buy a thousand shares to control $315,000 worth of equity. Or I could control $315,000 worth of equity for $2,400. Like which would you rather do, right? First and foremost, I don't want to dump that kind of money into Chase. Why? Because the stock doesn't move significantly on a day-to-day basis. So here's how I like to think about this. With options when Chase increases by a dollar, my equity goes up a buck, right? If I have a thousand shares and the share price goes up by a dollar, I made a grand, right? My ROI is 0.32%. That's not really sexy. Now is it? It's probably not worth the risk in the event that the market should come in. Or the stock should maybe drop by 5% or 7%. It actually dropped by 5% the other day on rumors that overall expenses were going to be going up and revenue would be compressing. Now, conversely, I could take that exact same position with options. And with options, stock on the left, options on the right, if Chase stock moves a dollar, then my overall investment would go up by $700, which is an ROI of almost 29%. So think about this. How often does Chase stock go up or down by a dollar? Well, if it happens every single day, sometimes it happens multiple times in a day. So when you're in a stock position, that's more long-term equity investing. Trading is very different. Trading is very short term, short duration. We open a position. We close a position. Not only within the same day, you could swing and hold it a little bit longer, but we will typically close that trade within sometimes a matter of minutes. It could be one minute, five minutes, 15 minutes. Alberto will show you with his trades that he takes a longer duration approach. He'll let a trade run for maybe one, two, three hours. And he'll have no reason to exit the trade, which is how he'll get an ROI of two, three hundred percent. So stocks and options are very different. They're not the same strategy. So when people ask me, well, Bill, if you make so much money trading options, why are you not wealthier than Elon Musk? It's real simple and it's called risk management people. I'm not going to put $315,000 into an options trade because if I'm wrong, duration comes into play that damage could be monumental. So when we're trading options, we are trading a fraction of what we would trade with equity, but we will get 10 times the ROI in a fraction of the time. So what do options allow you to do? They allow you to define your market risk to the amount of the contract you bought. So we're going to take the exact same trades. Alberto, I'm going to say you're going to buy Chase stock at $315.50. I'm going to buy the options. So when Chase drops by 5% in a day like it did last week, Alberto just lost $15,000. Now he needs that to recover in order to get his money back. For me, holding the exact same no-sional value of the position, all I had at risk was $2400. And the biggest difference is once I saw Chase's stock start to break a technical level, I would exit my trade. And I would not lose the full $2400. Might lose $400.00, might lose $500.00, but I surely didn't lose $15,000. Because when you're invested in equities, and I see people trying to day trade equities, and I'm just like, what are you doing? Like this makes no sense to me. You have all risk and no reward. So I want you to understand that these are two very different vehicles. Now, for long-term investing, keep all your money in long-term stocks. And what you learn through us, you'll know when to buy a stock because it's undervalued, or you'll know when to sell a stock because it's overvalued. Now, with options, should be a very small fraction of your portfolio. So if you're net worth, for example, let's say it's $100,000, hypothetically, options trading should maybe represent 5% of your net worth, or 10% at the very most. And that is it. But this is not like saying, you know, YOLO, we're going to go all-in on Bitcoin at $125,000 a coin, which is now trading at $90. I mean, again, we're both bankers, right? So we lead with common sense, and two, is risk management, right? So think of options as if you're renting the stock for a day, or an hour, maybe, it's only a couple of minutes. So I would prefer to rent than to own when I'm trying to make exponential amounts of money. Now, my portfolio is doing something completely different, right? That's on the side. I've showed that to you. My five-year K-GAR on that is over 500%. So what I've learned with options when to buy and when to sell, and you'll see some of the trades that are in the discord are also equity trades, okay? So we're going to go into a position in draft kings equity, or we're going to go into Netflix equity, or we're going to sell out a Palantir equity. So you'll see both sides of the equation. But also understanding that with options, you make money when the market goes up, and you make even more money when the market goes down. So the one thing that we love is when we get a pullback, and when we get a market dump, because you have to remember, market moves on two behaviors. Greed and fear. Fear is always, always, always a much stronger emotion than greed. And when there is fear in the market, options, contracts, explode like you have never seen before. So we'll show you some of those examples, okay? So some of the common questions that I get, and I'm just going to highlight about 12 of them, and then we're going to take your questions in the chat here before we get into the community. But really pretty simple, right? So what's so attractive with trading options? Well, I kind of shared it with you, right? It's called leverage. So you can own a thousand shares of Apple for about 280 grand, or you can control I.E. rent Apple for the day for about $1,800 in premiums. So when you think about, well, what exactly is an options contract? One contract gives you the right to control 100 shares of a stock without the obligation to buying it, right for a fraction of the price. So I'll go out every day, and I'm going to rent in video, and then I give it back. I rent Apple, I give it back. I rent the ETFs, SPY, QQQ, I give it back. I really don't care what happens from day to day. This is my trading mindset. It is not my long-term investing mindset to totally different things, okay? So I've heard that options trading is just gambling. Is that true? Yeah, we see it every day, right? I'll watch people in the discord, and they're like, all right, I'm taking calls here. I'm like, oh my God, what are you doing? Like you are gambling. This makes no sense. You don't have a price level. You don't have a FIB level. You don't have a fair value gap. You don't have anything technically that says the market is going to go higher. And your gut feeling is not a reason to take a trade. So when you hear that, oh, options, you're going to lose everything. You're going to lose your house, so on and so forth, first and foremost, right? Those people don't know they're asked for a hole in the ground. Excuse my French. But they don't even know what an option's contract is. They don't even understand how to define risk. And they also don't understand that the broker will never let you sell or buy a naked put contract, right? You just would not have access to it. You don't have the experience. You don't have the credentials. You don't have what's needed to get into the trouble like Melvin Capital did with the whole game stop issue four years ago. That is done with leverage and that is done with options, but you're not going to have that capability. So what do these people do? First and foremost, most people who bad mouth trading, him never traded today in their life because they were never a trader, right? They were greedy. They were desperate. They were in financial straits. And they thought it was just a good idea that their intuition is always really good. Well, I'm here to tell you statistically their intuition will never beat our technical analysis. So what do they do? They blame the game, but they never blame the player. Okay. And that's where I will always call bullshit. Show me your trade. Show me your charts. Alberta will ask you show me your CEST and then we can talk. Okay. This is a skill, people. I can't emphasize that enough. And if you're willing to learn the skill, it is insanely, insanely lucrative. Okay. But if not, you're just gambling. So you may as well come see me in Vegas. Let's go down to the ballad deal. We'll get some free drinks. We'll sit at the crap stable and we'll see who does better. Okay, because there is a difference. So Bill, your returns look too good to be true. What's the catch? Oh, there isn't. It's the power of leverage. It's the power of options. Right? Stock moves a dollar in a day. An options contract can move by 30%. Some will move by 60. Some will move by 90. Gus, one of our analysts had that happen this week and the trade went up over a thousand percent in GM. But he had really good rationale and an explanation why he took the trade that started at eight dollars and it went all the way up to 103 if I'm not mistaken. So you literally can turn 80 into 800, a thousand into 10,000. Now does that happen every day? The answer is no. Right? They're more outliers. But when you see what the consistent returns are from a capability perspective, it's really hard to argue. So people always want to know how much can I make? Bill, how much do you make? So the one thing I'm always going to do is get your attention off of me, Alberto, Gus, Rice and the other analysts that are in the community. Don't worry about what we are making, right? We make a ton of money at this. So you need to be worried about isn't duplicatable and do I have the ability to learn the skill? If not, you're just chasing money, my friends. And as the old adage goes, right, whatever you chase, it will forever elude you. And then trading is the exact same way. I average trades 30 to 100% return daily. But again, if you chase it, you're going to lose it all. And we've seen students lose it all. They've lost thousands, tens of thousands, 50 of thousands of dollars, right? And it comes down to that they were not using risk management. They let greed take over and then it just becomes another form of gambling, right? And they didn't build these billion dollar casinos here in Vegas on a bunch of winners. So the market will take your money so darn fast, you have no idea. And that's why we lead with two premises. First and foremost, is always going to be education, education, education. And then the second one is risk management. And if you can do those two things well, you'll do phenomenal. But if you don't learn how to do things the right way, and you don't practice risk management, this becomes a casino in your home, in your car, in your office, on your phone. I'm being very transparent, guys. It's just how it is. Okay. Just a couple more and then we're going to take your questions. So what is the risk to reward? So in every trade we get into, we can figure out what the RR is, right? Risk to reward. So I like to look for trades that I have a one to one or a two to one, meaning a risk of dollar to make a dollar or a risk of dollar to make two dollars, right? This is all about technical analysis. And when you look at the market and you learn the charts, the market moves in liquidity zones. It's not hard to predict what the market is going to do. It's only going to go up or it's only going to go down with software, with technical analysis and charting, we will be right 80% of the time. There is no such thing as a perfect trader. Nobody as a perfect record, right? My win rate is somewhere between 78 to 82%. Just depends on the day. Depends on the trade. The good news is you can even take losing trades, but then your winners will make up for those losers times two times three. And you see that even in my post, right? You'll see yesterday. I had a couple losing trades. I don't even know what they were. Maybe Nvidia and Apple, right? Didn't hold the price level. And I post my losses in the discord just as much as I post my gains, okay? But my spine, my QQQ were both up a thousand dollars. So yeah, did I lose 300? Oh, that's okay. Yeah. The next trade made a thousand. So net net, right? You're up 700 bucks. So look at the net effect, okay? Over anything else. So how much do I risk for trade? And again, this is where I'm going to scowl a lot of you throughout our time together. Inquit worrying about me, right? Everyone wants you to bill. How much did you make? How much are you trading? That's I've been doing this for nine years. I can do this in my sleep. My average trade is between three and 10 grand, okay? That's just where my comfort level is. But for beginners, you should be starting with a hundred bucks or three hundred bucks. Because the focus has to be on education, risk management, and the skill. Because I promise you, if you can't make money with a hundred dollar trade, you sure is, oh, cannot make money on a ten thousand dollar trade. And if you do, I'm the first to tell you, and Alberto will agree with me, you probably got lucky. And we're going to look at some comments probably in the discord where you're going to see that people said I traded really shitty today, but I still made tens of thousands of dollars, okay? I don't reward that and I don't celebrate that. Because you didn't lead with risk management that will allow you to do this like me professionally as a full-time career as well as, again, nine years, right? I mean, why invest the time and the money if you're just going to gamble? It just makes no sense to me. So if I'm only risking three to ten grand, how do I get returns to 20,000? Well, it's really simple again, right guys? Which, so if I buy ten contracts in Apple for $1800, and I'm controlling almost 280 grand in shares, and it goes up by five bucks, the contracts can move by 500%. So as we're 1800, it turns into like $9,600 in no time at all, okay? This is what you need to understand. And then how much time is required to be successful? This is not all I'm going to get up, roll out of bed, come sit at the computer, and you know, just can't be trained, bill, Alberto, Gus, Bryce, and everybody else. You can do that, but you're just short-changing yourself. You are not doing yourself any justice in the attempt to learn the skill. But on the days you can trade, I'm going to say you need an hour a day to become proficient in learning the skill, which is preferably, at least for me, on the market open. Now there are some analysts that trade throughout the day like Gus, like Alberto does, right? But for the most part, me, Bryce, and Anthony are done after the first 60 to 90 minutes. And I like to make my money, go to the gym, have some lunch, take a nap, and then we'll do whatever the afternoon brings me, right? One-on-one coaching, mentoring of students, so on and so forth. But you really need to take this seriously and run it like a business and don't manage it like a hobby. Okay? So, how much do I need to get started? At a minimum, you have to have $1,000, right? I'm not asking you to come in with 5 grand, 10 grand, 20 grand. You do not need that kind of money. And if you told me you wanted to put that in your brokerage, I'm going to tell you no. And the reason is, because the more you have in that account, the more contracts you're going to want to try to trade. It's called the psychology of greed. Well it's there, it ain't doing anything, so I should use it. No, you should not, right? And then you will learn with us that every trade has a different position size. So some trades are 30 pounds for me, some are 50, some are 100. Some, I was playing the day before FOMC, I was playing with two contracts. And I was playing with a hundred bucks, right? These are was rationale that says statistically the day before or the day of FOMC, the market is very unpredictable. And these are things you will learn, okay? You also need about $150 a month for software and indicators. So we use thinker swim for the broker. We use IBKR if you're in Canada, some other parts of the world. But if you're going to take the masterclass, do not set up software in advance. You will run the risk of getting denied and decline the ability to trade options. And then you will just have wasted a ton of time for nothing, okay? How do we minimize losses? We use a stop loss, right? I mean my average trade, if it invalidates on the chart, I will stop out with a loss of 30 to 40%. But I'm never losing 100% of my trade. So if I'm going in with three grand, right, I might lose $300, $600. It's all right. I have the opportunity to sell my contracts and say, hmm, the market did not go in the direction I wanted it to go. So we pull that money off the table. How long does it take to learn until you become consistently profitable? It's a loaded question, but I'm going to say about 90 days. And then the ultimate deciding factor is, how quickly are you willing to get sick of your own stupidity? Again, guys, winning traders look in the mirror, losing traders look in the mirror, okay? But if you're a losing trader and you don't look in the mirror, you're going to stay a losing trader. And until you stop doing stupid shit, and that is my quote that I'm going to put on a t-shirt and give it to everybody in the community, right? Stop doing stupid shit and you will make a ton of money, but you keep doing stupid shit. And you're like, I know, I know, I got to stop. Whatever. All right. Well, you know, keep losing money. But it's so easy to make, buddy, at this. If you would just get rid of the bad behaviors, right? It's like saying, okay, I'm overweight. I know I'm overweight. I feel awful, right? But I don't want to go to the gym. And I want to keep eating a bag of potato chips every day, right? Or you wake up this morning and you're hung over and you're like, I really should quit drinking, but then you have plans tonight to go time one on with the buddies at the local pub. I mean, you're going to wake up tomorrow with a hangover, trading is the exact same way. Good behavior, good results, bad behavior, bad results. So how do I know what to buy and when? Well, the cool thing is, right? The community we built, we have five analysts which provide buy cell signals with screen sharing, with complete education. We are here to first and foremost educate. When people say, well, can we just join and copy trade you? You can, but I think you're an idiot. I'm just going to be honest. What good is that going to do you? I mean, yeah, you're going to make money just doing what I do. But I think it's at this service to yourself. I really do. And I'm like, I highly advise against it. It'll work for a period of time, but it won't work for years. And what we have built is a system that will not only work this year. It'll work in 2026, 2027, 2028. Right? And while we're not going anywhere in the community will be around, you know, probably until I formally retire and handed over to Alberto in 10 years, I'm here. Right? But your mindset should not be while I'm just going to do what Bill does. I mean, how many times does that worked out for you in your life? I'm just going to do what my buddy does before you know it. You're in handcuffs sitting in the police station at 2 a.m. OK. So what will I learn in the master class? So literally everything. It's 18 hours of comprehensive training, which allows students to have an incredible understanding how to profit from the start. I said earlier, guys, I am all about education. If you think you're just going to shortcut everything and be like, oh, well, I'll just get into the discord and just learn from there. You're wasting your time and you're wasting your money. You're going to be lost. You're not even going to have your software set up correctly. You're not even going to understand what EMAs are, VWAP, price levels, liquidity, supply and demand, MACD, fair value gaps. Right? There is education that goes behind the skill. It is not, well, I'm just going to get in and do what these guys do. I watch people do it. And inevitably, every one of them says, Bill, I lost money. Cancelling the discord. I need to take the class. I'm like, no shit. I told you that in the beginning. OK. But you want to try and do it the hard way. Go ahead. Guys, I'm 54 years old. I'm too old to do things the hard way anymore. I did that my entire career and it did not pay dividends. OK. So the next class that I'm going to teach, which Alberto is also a part of for our master class pro students and the one-on-one coaching starts on January 12th. The registration is already open. So what happens after class? Nothing. We are here for as long as you need us, right? The community is here for each and every one of you, right? We do trade reviews. We answer questions. We are an unlimited resource, which is a wealth of knowledge to help you perfect this actual skill. So those are the Q&A's that I wanted to go through that are always asked from everybody. In Alberto, I'll switch over to you to see if there was anything in the chat that we need to answer. Yeah. And so there are a couple of questions that were here somewhere to ask. How do you get a 28.57% ROI in the example where Chase increases in value by $1? Yeah. It's options, right? And options is leverage. So you have to understand when you're trading one contract. In my example, I was trading 10. When you're controlling an options contract, you're controlling $280 or $380,000 worth of value that contracts explode. So that contract gives you the right to buy the stock at a future price in time, but you don't have the obligation. And it's just the function of options. You buy an option for $100 to control 100 shares. When Chase's stock goes up by $1,000, those 100 shares are exponentially worth so much more that the underlying contract explodes in value. So we are buying and selling contracts. We are not buying and selling shares. Yep. Will Overseas, a high bill, I asked my E-Trade partner to open options trading access. What level options trading covered, naked strategy you covered? Yeah. So we will cover longer duration option trades, whether you want to do an Iron Condor, calendar call, directional buy, directional put, straddle, so on and so forth. Now we use thinkorswim for everything. The master class is built around trading. It is not built around investing. So while I do have a section that shows you exactly what the more complex strategies are that are used for longer term investing, we are directional traders on market momentum for the day. I am not putting trades out there to simmer or be out there for a week or two weeks or a month. With this current administration, there is just so much volatility in a given day. I just want to make my $1 to $3,000 a day and be done. Now, in my long term portfolio, it is very different. For there, I am usually selling out of the money covered calls and stocks that I am holding. So whether it is an Ex-Unmobile, a Facebook, a Meta, Google, so on and so forth, that is where we will use the other strategies if you will. But on a daily basis, all we are doing is buying calls, selling them, buying puts and selling them. Awesome. We got one from Roy, a couple of questions in here. I am going to take a stab at this if you don't mind. Absolutely. I think this is going to be... So you asked a few questions below in case you have time to cover. What timeframes are you charting on and what timeframes are you trading on and do they vary? Yeah, so I would tell you is when you understand what your trading strategy is, you are going to be able to figure out, are you a zero DTE kind of day, meaning you are going to scout? Are you an intraday trader where maybe you are holding onto a zero DTE, maybe a one day DTE? Are you going to go look at individual stocks which is going to be a weekly DTE or are you a swing trader, right? Where you are looking. So everything is going to vary on the time frame of what kind of trading strategy you are. And that is what we are going to be able to teach you to understand because when you learn the technical analysis on charting, then timeframes matter to what you are doing. Do you have a favorite chart pattern? I, you know, Bill, you can answer this, but I am going to say I just stick to basic supporting resistance. That is how simple that is. What is the longest you are willing to sit into a trade? I think this is where Bill and I always crack at each other because I am incredibly patient and he is going to get in and out faster. So he might get in with a few minutes. My average trade will probably last somewhere between 15 to maybe an hour and I will let a runner go for about three hours. Bill is going to be in there within what, Bill, maybe one, two, five, seven minutes. Yeah. My average trade is probably five minutes long. Yep. Favorite indicators, I will tell you right now, I rely heavily on understanding how price action moves. It is the same thing that we teach. And so I rely heavily on that. I will use indicators to back in to support the analysis of what I am looking for. And then how many time frames are you looking at simultaneously? Three. I only look at three time frames. And they all work in sync together. You have to understand how time frames work because if you are trying to take some daily trade on a one minute thinking that you are going to go $10, you are going to be sitting there and then wondering why you lost money because it does not work the same exact way until you understand how that moves. And then how many trades are you willing to take at the same time or do you rather wait and get out of the trade? I am a one trade per time. Yeah. I tell people all the time. I tell all of our students, I cannot tap my head and roll my bill at the same time. So I am not trying to make a bunch of money on multiple things. There are so many trades out there that I would tell you it is silly. I mean people who say I missed out, you just don't know what you are looking for and that is what we help you on. Yeah. That is a good point. On Friday, so for example, I got into a Netflix trade. And I am just like, all right, well, I am just going to leave this one alone and then I will go look for SP Y and QQQ. But in my active trader grid, I have four ATs where I can be trading four different options contracts simultaneously. So once you are in the money or the trade is green, I will put a stop loss in profits. So I don't have to babysit the trade and then as the trade makes more money, I just move my stop loss up to protect profits. But then I will go on to something else. So depending on what your trading style is, we will help you set up your active trader where you could trade four, six, eight equities, you know, options contracts at the same time. Now I advise against it because I don't know how the heck you would manage all those stops. But you can do it. Now let's see you run a trend day with SP Y or QQQ. You can jump in both contracts, right? You could active trader one, jump in spy calls, active trader two, jump in QQQ calls and they're side by side. So then you're just back and forth moving up your stops. So a lot of it depends on your own personal preference. Yep. Are you considered to be a day trader and if so, what are the tax implications? Yeah. So from a tax perspective in the United States, I can't speak to what happens in other countries around the world because we do have a lot of global students. You have to beat your tax at 40% short term capital gains, right? And you might be thinking to yourself, wow, 40%, that's a lot of money. Okay. Well, there's a couple of things you can do. First and foremost, if your trading is an individual, it's just 40% short term. There's nothing you can do about it. But I'm also going to ask you, where else are you going to go and make $2,000 in five minutes, right? So the government is always going to have their hand out at is what it is. Depending upon what your relationship sizes with the broker with TOS, which is thinker swim, Charles Schwab, I trade in an LLC. Okay. So my trading is not done as an individual. I trade as a business. So therefore I deduct my computers, my monitors, my home office, my broker fees, my cell phone, my Wi-Fi, my travel, my dining and entertainment. So some of the students have come to Vegas and we go to dinner and I pick up dinner and my trading pays for the dinner. So it just really depends upon you as an individual and how that works. And ask are the discourse recorded? We don't record anything from the discourse. And that's the, are you referring to live martin from just a timestamp? I mean, that stuff is all in there, which builds in the show you in a minute. Yeah. There's no recording of the live trading, right? And there's no recording of the discord. So there's a host of legal reasons behind that. Okay. And there's some bad actors in this space that the SEC significantly frowns upon, right? We are not telling you what to buy. We are not telling you what to invest in. We are telling you what we are doing. And so therefore there's no reason to record it because once you miss the recording, it's too late, right? And it's just a matter of time, right? So I'm talking about the last thing that we have to adhere to, whether you're licensed or you're unlicensed. So I would just hope that you would respect that that's the rationale for why. David over from Ireland says is the master class the best option or are there other better learning options with you? Yeah. You have to start with the master class, David. And for you, the master class is, you know, in the middle of the night. Right. Live trading is in the afternoon. So that's kind of cool. I think it's 330 year time. What I would do is the master class, I run them only two to three times a year. January is going to be this class. Next one might be in April and then the next one will be in September. I don't do anything in the summer. I just want to enjoy my summers, have fun, swim in the pool, go on vacation, right? Spend a month in Italy, just kind of my new M.O. What you can do is everything is recorded. So I don't want you getting up in the middle of the night to learn, right? So join the master class, okay? Listen to the recording the next day. It's got all the recordings, all the handouts, all the materials, all the PDFs. And then if you have questions, I'm here to answer them. It's not an issue. But let's not lose sleep learning the skill. But the cool thing is when you're trading live with us, it's in the afternoon. Yeah, I'm going to be, I'm thinking about moving to Ireland now, going to the afternoon out there. And then, uh, uh, uh, Indra is starting from scratch. Is it possible that Charles Schwab or IBKR refuses me the right to trade the type of options used in the master class? Yeah, absolutely. If you don't answer the questionnaire correctly, which I walk you through the questionnaire, line by line, tell you exactly what to do and what to put. Uh, the 1000, almost 400 people that I have taught, I have only had two people that have ever been declined for options trading. And unfortunately, it's because they didn't do what I told them to do. And I'm not asking you to lie and I'm not asking you to manipulate. But if you come in like I have zero experience with options, I have no idea what I'm doing. Please grant me access. They have a fiduciary responsibility to protect you. And therefore, they're going to deny you. But I will tell you that this master class is better education and training than your actual financial advisor has in all honesty. And so therefore, out of 1400 people, two to get declined, um, they, one of them went to a different broker. They approved it. Uh, the other one, uh, had to wait 90 days before they could apply again. So it's a real simple process, but you can't tell them, well, you know, I'm, I'm a third grader and I don't know what I'm doing. I just, I don't mean to insult anybody, but come, right, it just doesn't work. I'll leave it there. Yep. Brett, uh, ask if you do not have 25,000 account, do you need to have the account set as cash settlement, correct? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So this is a huge misnomer, right, where people don't understand, um, the broker rules. And I walk you through all of that in the master class. So if you have less than 25,000, you cannot have margin turned on, okay? And that's where the broker gets you. We talk about this in the setup. Almost every broker automatically turns on the margin because they make more money on your brokerage account. So therefore if you just turned it off, you're trading cash and everything is T1 settlement, which means everything settles today and the funds are available tomorrow. But we walk through all of that timing. I believe it's in session number three. Yep. Uh, Lawrence asks, does a discord help you set up your profile to trade options from Canada, not the discord itself, uh, but through the master class, you, you figure out how to set up, uh, your provider trade options. And then Julie over asked, how often do you start a new master class if timing doesn't work for me to join in the January class? Yeah. So like I said, the next one will probably be in April and then the one after that September. But join the cool thing is right. If you join the class, um, everything's recorded, all the handouts, all the material and it's unlimited access. It doesn't expire. So if you're like, well, January doesn't work, but I'm available in February, we'll just take the January class, right? All the recordings are there, jump into the community with us. And then if you have questions, right? I mean, that's what I spend my afternoons doing is answering questions and helping people. So, uh, I have a whole time job in a side hustle, time management as crucial for the training classes, what daily weekly commitment does it require? Mm-hmm. So the next class starts on January 12th. It's Monday, Wednesday, Friday for two consecutive weeks at 5.30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. So that would be 7.30 Central, uh, 8.30 Eastern in each class is about two and a half hours long. Mm-hmm. Yep. Uh, does that ask how much time do you spend trading during the day? I want to for both of us. Uh, most of my trades are going to be within the first 90 minutes of the open. From time to time, I will go into what we call power hour or maybe there's a setup that's happening. One of the ways that I trade a little bit later in the day is only if an alert goes off. That's it. I'm not sitting at a chart. If an alert goes off on me, based on what I did on my technical analysis, either the prior night or the morning of, then I go on about my day. Otherwise, I'm done at the market open because that is when the big institutional money is moving throughout the entire time. Yeah, you're exactly right. I'm done within the first 60 minutes, 90 at the most, and then I, I, I'll see you tomorrow, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Uh, may or also I am a complete new bad trading. Does the training have a prerequisite before joining? Nope. We teach you every single thing that you're going to need to learn here. You're almost better off not knowing a whole lot because we teach you everything. Make it easier in yourself. Um, do you need to set up your Swab account? Is it business or individual? Yeah, totally your call, right? I trade as an escort because I also pay myself a salary. So from my trading profits, I pay myself a W2 and then the CPA that we use in the community only does accounting for traders. So it's very specialized business. Awesome. And then I'm going to let me, uh, this is the last few questions. Can you, uh, excuse me? Is the masterclass for beginners? Yes, it is. I'm actually 100% set up that way. Um, what are, what are, what are starting stop time for the January masterclass still? Um, so starting stop time. So 5 30 PM Pacific Standard time is when they start, right? And they each last about two and a half hours. So awesome. Yeah. And then the last one, did you get access to the same content for master options? So learn on your own versus foundation versus mastery. All the content is exactly the same. The only difference is, um, uh, the discord access, right? So if you do the learn on your own, you just join the discord separately. If you do the foundation, then it includes six months of discord. If you do the pro, then that's going to be one on one coaching with me for at least five hours. And then it's an additional three hours worth of Alberto. So it's another eight hours of very detailed one on one coaching, looking at data, analytics, and everything else. So yeah. And the last one up and to hear how technically skilled do you need to be if so, how much is this aspect important for us? Because you don't, I mean, we're literally teaching this isn't, this isn't like, you know, you're learning a skill and you have to understand how the skill works. So it's not about what you're learning college or, you know, how sound you are with algebra or mathematics. It's literally understanding where and how the market moves and its market dynamics and understanding what does the behavior? You got to remember the market moves in the behavioral pattern based on psychology. People get scared, people get greedy. So the market is made of millions of people with emotion, just like you and myself. And so when you understand how it moves, then you draw out your technical analysis based on that, not based on, you know, some kind of formulated way of doing it. Is that fair to say no? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would agree. And the master classes for beginners, right? Rather than me trying to, you know, fix bad behaviors. But everything with regard to, if you have other questions around software setup, CPA, just email me options at billfanter.com. I'm happy to answer them. But I do want to keep going so that you can kind of see some of the other things. And I think Jeff, you're probably even on with us, right? So, you know, it really does in reinforced. These are just some comments that I got over the last couple days. But it really does take discipline knowledge, right? And faith in yourself. I talk about that all the time. Quit worrying about Bill. Let's worry about Alberto. Let's worry about Jeff. Let's worry about Mark. Let's worry about Stacy, right? It's us working with you to figure out where are the hangups. But yeah, you get out of a trade, you know, 30% win. That's good. But the trade went up over 300%. Right? So you just think about the ROI for some of this stuff, you know? And then everybody who's in our community are professionals. I am not targeting 19 year olds working at McDonald, selling them on a get rich quick scheme. And that's not my ICP. That's not my client. That's not part of our community, right? Everybody, the 1200 traders that are in the community are all highly successful, six, seven figure professionals, right? But it is about community. And we joke in the community all the time, all the ignorant idiots that say this is a scam. And it's hilarious because they're the ones who are getting scam going to work for nine to five job for somebody else who's probably a control freak. And then they ultimately get scammed when they get laid off, right? And that was one of those fools, right? I got laid off three times in five years. I mean, are you kidding me? And imagine that going into 2026, 2027 with the job market, right? But Craig said it best, right? This is not about quick money. It provides you the tools to trade. Helps with the setups, the live trading. So we reinforce what we teach, right? And so if you're willing to learn the skill, the community is incredible. The education is immense. It is worth a hundred times the cost. Because when you see that, and you might say, yeah, we'll build the masterclass a little expensive. It's three grand. Well, Jeff just made a thousand dollars in a given day. And if he would have stayed in the trade longer, he would have made three grand in a day. I need to raise the prices, Alberto. Right. And so these are some of the most people always ask, Bill, if you're such a good trader, why do you teach? This sums it up right here, guys. Right? I ran banks for 35 years, $10 billion banks, 1400 employees. I led a lot of people. I transformed a lot of lives. I'm retired. I don't have that. Unfortunately, Freeman does not want me transforming his life anymore. He does not want me coaching him. No different than Alberto. I'm sure your wife doesn't want you coaching her, right? So paying it forward to others. But here was a message I just got from Mark yesterday in the discord, right? You just want to say, Bill, my mom's been ill. She had a stroke. I want to go see her. I hope your mom's doing better. You know, blessings and thinking of you. And I reply back. I'm grateful. Thank you for the well wishes, right? And he replies with this. Right, I don't ask for this. They just send it, right? Feel free to use this narrative on LinkedIn to combat the scam narrative. But we're adopting a baby boy. Do this month. And with the profits over the last six weeks, we have fully funded 100% of the cost. If that isn't life changing, I don't know what is. So thanks to you in the community, right? And that's what this is about is helping people achieve their why. I don't know what your why is. Maybe it's to pay down debt. Maybe it's to retire early. Maybe it's to retire your wife. Maybe it's to retire your husband. Maybe you want to trade as couples, right? Scott and his wife trade as couples every morning. We get we get so many cool people. But or like Adi, you'll see Adi in the discord. And her token phrases, I'm going to take my bag and run, right? Where she makes money. It's really good at this. But you've taught me how to change my life. I can't repay you enough. You fix something intangible for me that other people could not. I no longer accomplishments starve. I felt misaligned almost everywhere until now. I love that. I mean, are you kidding me? Or, you know, look at this, right? I keep making micro adjustments. This is one of my biggest trades ever built. And I omitted the trade because the money doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it was 100, 1000 or 10,000. But I'm green for the third month in a row in gaining confidence to increase the amount of contracts while managing risk. And this is what we talk about all the time, guys. Education, risk management, education, risk management. If we can educate you and you can manage risk, we can do amazing things together. But if you don't want to get educated, and you're reckless in human behavior, I can't help. Now, I will tell you, I have turned people away. You know, that they've said Bill, I have a gambling problem, right? Or I have a drinking problem. And I applaud them for telling me that because that psychologically is going to make things much, much harder for us to help them have success. But what I want to do is I want to jump into the discord. I'll show you exactly how this works. You will get an email from me after this ends. And I'll let the video upload where I'll send back the video replay. But this is what a discord community looks like. And we are live in the discord itself, where I'm going to walk you through a couple of the sections. I'll make this a little bit bigger. But what we have is we have a welcome section. There's a video here how to use the discord. Managing your membership is all done through a separate company called WAP. So I'm going to give all of you free access to the community for a week, seven full days. You are going to, and the instructions will be in the email. You're going to download the discord app. You are going to click the link that I'm going to give you in WAP that will allow you to join the community, which will give you access to everything you're seeing. If you do not cancel within seven days, it will charge you the monthly fee. I want to be just abundantly clear. I can't change that. I can't fix that. There's nothing I can do. But I didn't want to just send you live trading links because I want you to see how powerful this community is. Disclaimer, this is the disclaimer I started at the beginning of our presentation. Chat rules, right? No spam, no affiliate links advertising. I don't want religious beliefs, political beliefs, any of that stuff in the community. This is a trading community. If there's any market announcements, I will call them out for you to see all the time. So these were some sales that we were having on trade zella, trading view, trade zella. Again, I put out a weekly watch list that's a video. I will subscribe each of you to it. So you will get it on Sunday. Every Sunday, I put out a weekly watch list of how I would trade the market. It's totally free. It's on YouTube. You will get that. We are also posting what are earnings announcements for the week. We want to be aware of what companies are going to announce earnings so that we could potentially take a play post earnings or if we're in a position that is in a swing trade, we might want to trim the profits before they actually announce. We put out a watch list on a daily basis. This is Gus and Anthony, two of the analysts within the community, where they will give you all of their charts. They will tell you exactly how they are going to trade. For example, this is Nvidia or how they are going to trade QQQ. Or this one is how they're going to trade Broadcom. And this is all the technical analysis, all their price levels, we teach you how it works. But you will note that when there are price levels on a chart, it's called liquidity, the market observes it. And that's how we can be correct 80% of the time with our trades. My channel has all of my charts in the morning for the futures data, for the ETFs, for SPY, and QQQ, as to how I would trade. We also show volatility along with an indicator we used to say this is where the buyers are at in the green. This is where the sellers are at in the red. So we would obviously want to buy where there are buyers. And we would want to sell where there are sellers. We'll also do a heat map showing you what's moving pre-market, things that will keep an ion from technology, consumer cyclical, health care, or financial. And then there will be the live trading zoom link, where you will trade live with me on Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, and then you will trade live with Alberto on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Everything I shared earlier is timestamped. So this is a great example of a trade that Gust took. Yesterday at 8.33 in the morning, he bought Tesla 450 calls at $97. At timestamped 917, they were up 50%. At 920, this is about 50 minutes later, they were up 80%. If we go here, timestamped 938 AM, he's trimming them or selling some at 105%. And then he finally cut the rest of the trade being up 130%. And then his QQQ, 618 call from the live trading was up 42%. So Gust is an analyst. He also trades live every day. His brother Anthony is an analyst. They trade live every day on Zoom. Bryce is another analyst that I've been with for five or six years now, where he will call out all of his trades along with his charts, telling you what he is buying, the price that he is paying, why he is in the trade with liquidity, with momentum. And then he will show you where he is selling his charts. Again, QQQ is by 37% gain. Where else does he go? 32% gain on SPY. And then if you held the trade longer, 59% gain, and then those calls from earlier went up 112. So we're showing you the charts. We're telling you what we're buying. We're telling you when we're buying. We're telling you what the ROI is. Everything is timestamped. Flint is another analyst who trades throughout the day. This is his recap up through December 9th. He didn't update it since, but these are all the trades he called out in the community. And the ROI, 15% 420, 330, 200, 280, you get the hint. But we do take losing trades, guys. QQQ puts no dice. SPY calls no dice. And he was swinging a couple trades. But this was a US bank trade that he got into, that he called out live. Here it was up 130%. Here it's now up 200%. Let's go a little further and see where it moves to. And you'll see, again, his charts, his technical levels, all the details, everything else. Here we're up 230% on US bank. I did a post on it. The US bank employees all love to see when we're making 560% on their bank stock while they're getting laid off in record numbers. I just do like to point that out. And then so Alberto has his own channel. Again, he was a student of mine a year and three months ago. Why he had to convince to take the master class? And he was like, now Bill, I don't think this is for me. And then he literally goes from student to educator, to instructor, to analyst, to crushing it every single day. So I'll let you talk through kind of your channel and how you manage your notifications. Yeah, so what I'll do is every morning, you'll notice here, I will give you what's on watch. So what am I watching? And I'll give you a side by side of you with the futures along with the EFT that I'm looking at. And then if there's an individual ticker, like in this case, you're gonna see that there's a GE. I will look in, I'm telling you, volume will be important. If we get above that level of 295, I'm telling you, volume will be important. And you'll see in a minute, this particular stock, a trade ended up just skyrocketing. And then I'm showing you here where I got in. So I got in on this 256 put. I got filled at 29 on WM and I'm telling you, it's already up 60%. And you keep moving through. And I'm telling you, CESC, everything that I just showed you in that pre-market is working out. And it's playing out and I'm telling you, if you took any of those trades with me, you would have got in. And then I'm showing you what happened. So it took 100 contracts on 27. And then I sold 90 of them at 49. Or what was it, 49? Yeah, 49, 90 of them, right? And this goes back, if you just follow that chart, it would have taken you back. Here, I'm telling you what my runners are. So I've trimmed my position. I'm left with these. They're up 136 and 157 is what they are. Yeah. And so, right, I mean, love it. Everything's timestamped. Everything is documented. Profits are shown. No smoking mirrors, no games, no nonsense, no bullshit. I mean, guys, we do this every day. This is a profession that we take so incredibly serious, right? It's reputation. And then we have in the community right now, over 1,119 people, you know, almost 1,200 people relying on us, relying on us for education, for accuracy, for helping them to learn and master this skill. I mean, this is not a joke and this is not gambling, right? Scam alert, when you get into the discord, we will never reach out to you. Me, Gus, Bryce, Flint, Iceman, none of us will reach out to you. If you get a DM and it looks like me, because it'll have my picture, it is a scammer, okay? I can't preclude that from happening, but my name will be spelled wrong. My first name will be spelled wrong. There'll be a period, a dash, a comma, right? Something where it is not me. We will never DM you in the discord. We will not friend request you. We will not ask for your bank info. We will not ask you for crypto. We will not ask you for cash. We do not offer a copy trading program. It is a scam. So please make sure you are aware of that. We'll do trade recaps, right? So this is one that I actually recorded, where I'm showing exactly my trade, my active trader, okay? And then I'll show it over to the actual charts as to what I'm doing from an overall charting perspective. So, right? You can see the rationale, the understanding, and we explain why we take the trades. Post your gains, so this is all the trades in the community, these are trades from yesterday. Let's see, $1,800, $1,200 from Tapo Berry, Mark, six for six trades. He's the one who's also doing the adoption, right? Six for six winners, Briar Fox, 33%. Here we had a winner and a loser, right? Up one down one. Let's see, IWM puts green, made $7,000, buster, this is my profit from yesterday and here. Proof, I take losing trades, right? Lost 140 on Nvidia, lost 30 bucks on Apple, made 1,300 on Spy, before the day ended. I made another 700 on QQQ, so it was up over 2 grand. But you're gonna take losing trades. It's just, nobody has a perfect score, guys, right? Here's some ROI, 53% 9% on two trades. And again, you could take our trades, you could take your own trades, here's Addy. Addy took her Amazon and ADM puts, right? Ran with the bag, and that's her signature quote, and I love that, you know? I made my money, I'm outta here, right? Picked up some AMD 60% profit. So whether you wanna trade 100, 1000, and you're not advised you trade 10 grand out of the gate, right? But just do the math, and that's why the dollars don't matter as much as percentages, right? Or Ricardo, right? Very disciplined today, no greed, a few runners, 64, 36%, right? 11%, Tesla 59%, tremendous amount of learning out of the discord through Iceman, aka Alberto, and Gus. And then this was Gus's, most traders, guys, are 20 and 30 years old, right? I'm the old guy in the room at 54, but Gus called out GM for the entire community, options went from eight bucks to 103, $1,000 returned. So, and then if you have losses, we encourage you, post the losses, right? Tiger 10, good friend of mine in Minnesota, right? Took a Fibble level, plus a fair value gap, and it was a loser, right? And we support that we're gonna take losing trades, but also what happened? Tell us what happened. You want us to review your trade, right? What happened? And if we could figure out what you did wrong, then we can help you get better. Here's Phil, he's in the UK, right? He had a rough day, right? Had some losses, okay? Two poor trades amongst these. The other losses were just getting stopped out deep in liquidity sweeps, bit frustrating, right? As they're now 100% trade. So these are examples, right? If you would have just stayed in the trade longer, technically, they all turn green. And then we talk a lot about psychology, right? Alberto, I know you put an article in here this morning that I thought was absolutely phenomenal, that talks about the psychology that goes not only with you, you know, as a former baseball player, but also now as a trader. And that's what we're constantly doing, guys, right? Is working on the psychological aspect as to where you're at in your journey. And we have some more where you can introduce yourself, ask any question if you need help with something you're lost, you're stuck, you're confused. We also have General Chat that we just have some fun with. We like playing with means, some videos, they're entertaining, trades that you're looking at or trade talk. So things that, you know, hey, I'm watching an AMD or Nvidia or taking calls here, right? Like what are we doing? And then if you are a futures trader, we had a couple that were talking about the futures and then trade ideas, just different things to think about or look at, totally a community with help. And then system settings, this is where we get into all the software, technicality, of how do I set up my IBKR, how do I set up my TOS? That's really done in the master class, but this is if you're stuck or the screens aren't doing what you want them to do. I triage it. If you're in Canada, we have a lot of Canadian students that can triage if you're using IBKR. We just have, we got a lot of tech people that trade with us. So they're really good at figuring out data speeds, Wi-Fi speeds, connection speeds, program software, you name it. And then we have a tools channel. These are webinars that we run for the community. So we normally don't trade on FOMC days, but here's how to set up IBKR. Here's how to use the TTM Squeeze Pro. Here's how to use Azure RooCBC Flip Software Program. So we do use different programs to help us technically manage the market. And then video tutorials, these are some of the webinars that we've done. Iceman actually hosts them using average true range, supplying demand, how to come up with a pre-market analysis, signs of fake outs versus breakouts, Umar, who is a very respected, famous professional trader, always gives good insights and then using confluence. And then some books and courses that we recommend, right? As you're evolving your trading journey, um, other resources that just help you have success. Then this next session is just all AI data analytics, reading the market flow of order flow, bullseye trade ideas, AI trade ideas, large option sweeps. So these are market makers buying, you know, millions of shares or, you know, paying millions of dollars of premiums to get into puts or calls. This one is for micron. They bought the 23750 put paid a million dollars in options premiums, right? Darkpool, we'll talk about what that is, but this is like we're a worn buffet would execute his trades. They're not done on the open market. They're done after hours, um, different stocks that are getting analyst upgrades and downgrades. Maybe you want to trade those again, AI scalping ideas. So you're looking for other ideas in today, right? A bullish reversal on a one hour in the stock, N O W tells you where to take the long position, where the stock loss is and your potential profit, right? And then breakout trade. So this is a lot of what we trade is liquidity, right? Again, we could technically chart where a price level is and our stocks going to reject. It's going to come up. It's going to reject. It's going to come up. It's going to reject or it holds a level. It's going to bounce in the market, moves in liquid waves to the upside and to the downside, which is how we can actually be correct 80% of the time. We'll never be right 100% of the time, but in all honesty, I think 80s pretty darn good, right? So that's everything I wanted to cover. Alberto, any final thoughts from your perspective? Well, before we do just one last quick question from Douglas discord access and cost is that part of the Masterclass Foundation? Yes. So the foundation has six months of discord. And then if you want to stay on, it's $150 a month. The pro is 12 months of discord access. And if you want to stay on after a year, $150 a month. But all the history is in the discord. So when you guys join the discord from the link I'm going to send you, okay, in about an hour and a half, because this video has to process, you will have access to all of this. There is one caveat. You have to join discord.com with your email. And then when you click on the link in WAP to get access, you have to use the same email. You cannot use an email for one in a different email for the other. It'll monkey the system up. And then again, it's a seven day free trial. If you don't cancel within the seven days, it's going to bill you $150. Again, full transparency, okay? I'll be live trading on Monday. The link will be in my channel under Fanta trades at 6am. You'll see all of my charts in about 5.30, 6am will be the link. You'll be on live with me on Zoom, live trading the market, watching my screenshots, listening to my narrative. I'm going to give you the pre-market analysis. Then you'll be with Alberto on Tuesday. You'll be with me on Wednesday. You'll be with Alberto on Thursday. You'll be with me on Friday. Now, simultaneously, Gus and Anthony are also trading the market live every morning. So if you don't want to listen to me, you can go listen to them, right? Or if you can't join live because you're at work, well, you can watch what Bryce is doing throughout the entire morning because he's typing and putting in all of his entries. So I start at 6am Pacific Standard Time, okay? Which is 8am Central, 9am Eastern, okay? Everything I'm on is in the Pacific Standard Time Zone. What are the questions that I missed that you guys want to get a little bit of clarity for? Just two, could this be a couple of questions here? Does the free week of access to Discord begin once we hit the link or does it begin today? Once you hit the link. So if you don't sign up till Monday, it'll start Monday. If you wait till Wednesday, it'll start on Wednesday. The only thing I ask is if you're doing it the morning of and you email me because you're having problems, I'm not gonna reply, okay? Cause I'm getting ready to trade. I'm getting ready to educate hundreds of people that are watching me. Can you use e-trade? You can use whatever you want, Don, right? You can use e-trade, you can use fidelity. It's gonna be really hard. You can use webowl, but I would not recommend that you use anything other than thinker swim or IBKR and you'll understand why when we show you how fast that software is to get in and out of the master class. And yes, Phil, I'll share the CPA with you. Her name is Raven at Trader's Accounting and it's actually under when you're in the Discord. Under, let me see tools. Right here. Yeah, right there. That's right. You can use e-trade tools and right here, okay? If you're in Canada, you have to trade on the IBKR platform but we would trade the US stocks in the US ETFs, right? Same thing if you're in Germany, you're in Switzerland or you're in Austria or you're in Australia, right? If students from all over the world you would never trade your country's liquidity, right? You would always trade US stocks, right? You would always trade what we have. Thanks, Phil. I appreciate the hat. You're awesome. Yeah, that's good. And this is community, guys, right? Oh, I mean, I'm so committed to helping other people succeed if you're willing to take it seriously, right? If you're gonna get a computer, make sure it's built for gaming. So typically anything within the last two years is good. I trade on an iMac, right? And then I also, I have a laptop that's also a Mac and then I have two external 40-inch monitors. One is for futures data, one is for my charting and then one is for order execution and we walk you through all of that in the masterclass as well. Everything from how to read the options chain, how to set up your brokerage account, how to set up your software, how to set up your hardware, all of anything that you could possibly need, guys, I have thought of it. And if you want, go to my website, billfanter.com, there's student comments out there, every comment has a link to their profile and LinkedIn. Reach out to some of these students, right? Get their take. How many students in the masterclass? I don't set a hard and fast number, but once the seats are full, I shut it down. So, and I will tell you that even though classes are gonna start on January 12th, on January 1th, I am going to increase the price. So, this is gonna be the last price that this is gonna sit at. So, if you're interested, right? You got about two weeks and right now there's 1,300 people on the wait list and the email just went out yesterday telling them that registration is open. So, if you're interested, grab a seat. But I can only manage so many people and answer questions and everything. It just becomes overwhelming for me. So, I've learned to cap the classes and just like, unfortunately, you got a wait. So, it's good. Don't do what I did in a waiting two years to finally be like, oh yeah. So, this is, okay, this worked out. Okay, got it. I think it's worked out pretty good for you, my friend. Yeah, it has. And the best part is, the best part you guys I would tell you is there's two things that I would just leave you guys with is number one. This is all about really you guys, right? Both Bill and I are here for your support to help you guys see what's possible. Another part of it I would tell you is understand when you walk into this, there is a learning curve. And so, you have to be able to mitigate that risk to understand you're not gonna do what we're doing today right out the gate. It is a learning curve, but the best part of all is we help you along the way with the support of this community on the discord where you don't feel like you're by yourself. A lot of people don't understand what you're doing and they think you're crazy. So, when you're taking losses, we're here to support you to help you find out what are the different areas or gaps that you need to be helped with. And then whether we take it on the side for someone on one coaching or we just share with you on this work is something very simple like a system issue. But the whole platform is set up so that we support you on your endeavor. Whatever that is that you're looking to accomplish, but you just have to understand, you cannot come in here thinking, I'm gonna sign over to the master class. And then all of a sudden tomorrow, I'm already gonna be able to retire from my W2 job. Just doesn't work that way. No, no, not at all. But cool, Alberto, I'm so grateful for not only your friendship, but your commitment to paying it forward and teaching others, right? How to get the hell out of corporate America because that should be a goal and an ambition for each and every one of us to spend more time with friends, family, and doing the things we love, like eating, drinking, and traveling to Europe, right? Yep, exactly. All right, thank you. Love it guys. So with that email be out in about an hour, hour and a half after this video is done processing, all the instructions are there. My email is there, you can email me questions with that. Happy holidays, everybody. And I will see you Monday morning for live trading if you're interested. Alberto will see you on Tuesday, and then I'll be back again on Wednesday and just soak this up and take advantage of this opportunity guys. I mean, it's a once in a lifetime if you ask me. So with that, I'll see you all Monday. Take care, take care, yeah, bye bye.",
