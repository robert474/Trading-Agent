 Hey, I'm Bill Fanter, founder of Options Action, and you're watching the weekly watch list. If you'd like to get access to this content before it goes live on YouTube, just hit the first link in the description to sign up for our free weekly emails. All right, let's jump right in. Welcome back, everybody. So this is going to be the watch list for Monday, October 13th. Let's go ahead and start and take a look at the US Economic Calendar, not much on the horizon. Monday, Columbus Day, the bond market will be closed, but the stock market will be open. So you might see some wonky price action. So I would definitely size down and be a little bit not overly cautious, but cognizant that we could get quite a bit of market chop in a lack of direction. You need the stock market and the bond market to work in unison for the markets to either go up or down. Now, on Tuesday, all we have is the NFIB Optimism Index, and then Wednesday and PyreState Manufacturing. But we do have quite a bit of Fed Governor speak. Here's going to be the hard part. On Thursday and Friday, we are definitely dependent upon government data. So whether it's retail sales, it's going to be the PPI, the initial jobless claims, business inventories, all of that data is needed for the FOMC to stay on their rate lowering path. Same thing with Friday. Housing starts building permits, import prices, industrial production. Now, rumor has it that the government has called back some employees that were on furlough to get them to be able to produce some of this data. Rationale behind it is they don't want Jerome Powell and the FOMC board to say, well, we have now a lack of clarity. I mean, we have no clarity. We have no guidance on what this market is doing or unemployment or inflation, because we have nothing to base an off of. So therefore, should we keep cutting rates? And as you know, the president wants lower rates. No questions asked, right? Powell, all your long is, you know, we believe that, we're gonna run into a bit of an issue with the job market, with unemployment. So they're more focused on that than they are, the inflationary pressures, but now they have no inflationary numbers. They have no jobs numbers. So do they just keep lowering rates? So do they use this as an excuse to say, hmm, we're gonna hold and see what the market does. Now, after the last FOMC minutes were released, indicating again, or confirming, two more rate cuts are coming this year. If those are taken off the table, the market is not going to like that, right? So the whole rationale for bi-equities, bi-equities, bi-equities is that earnings are good, unemployment is manageable, and rates are going to be coming down. So some of the things that we're gonna have to keep an eye on this week without question is going to be all about earnings, okay? So we are going to have some of the big banks announcing earnings on Tuesday. Again, Monday, nothing's going on because the bond market is closed, but we're gonna have Goldman City, Wells Fargo, okay? BlackRock. These are gonna be ones that we're definitely gonna wanna keep an eye on, as well as the regional banks as the market overall progresses. They should have JP Morgan Chase on here. Let me see where they, Bank of America, Morgan, citizens. Usually Chase is always the first to announce. So they should be here on Tuesday. I just don't see it, but I would anticipate that we're gonna get again, the big banks, Wells, City, Chase, okay? And then the following day you're gonna get Bank of America Morgan Stanley. What we're gonna wanna listen for is we're gonna wanna listen for specifically is the consumer still spending. What is going on with the savings rates? What is going on with consumer debt? Now, the one thing we do know is that the repossessions for automobiles is now back to an all-time high, which is as high as it was during COVID when everybody was unemployed, okay? So we're definitely gonna wanna watch the health of the consumer because we are a consumer-driven economy. So keep an eye on those. Those are also in the Discord community for you to reference and we'll see how they play out. But let's take a look at some overall individual names, QQQ, everything kind of was sold off, baby with the bath water. As soon as that tweet came out, market makes a new all-time high. And then we got a much-needed pullback, right? I'd still love to see this pullback even further. So when we are on a daily timeframe, big bearish engulfing candle, right? That literally wiped out what? 12, 15 days worth of growth, okay? So back here on Monday, the 15th, almost a month worth of progress to new all-time highs, almost day after day, it seemed like. We're getting a pullback. I'd love to see us pullback into this 560 area, okay? So back below this pivot high or come down and test this pivot high. We really don't have a good pivot high in here. We had one here, right, where we got a good drawdown and then we made it a leg up, but now we're coming right back to this. Will this be a buy the dip? I don't know about that. So the one thing that people never want to get caught doing is buying the top of the market, okay? So all of these people that put new capital to work over the last month are probably second-guessing themselves. Now, clearly you guys know, hope is not a strategy, so you just don't sit and do nothing. The other thing that happened on this huge massive red candle was a mass liquidation of the coin market, okay? So whether it was altcoins, Bitcoin, XRP, you name it. So the coin market and the, the me, some of them are mean coins, right? Some aren't, you know, like doge and what have you. But at the end of the day, they are all borrowing on margin. So they are buying all of these cryptocurrencies on margin. Well, when you have a drop of 10%, when you are purchasing on margin, you get a margin call. And now, what is the market maker not able to do? They are not able to reach out to all of their customers and saying, hey, you got a margin call, you need to deposit more funds in case this asset keeps dropping. So what happens? They just auto-liquidate every single position. And that's why you saw this huge dump in so many of the cryptocurrencies on Friday. It wiped out a trillion dollars worth of value, right? And just lift people like, what the hell just happened? So XRP, if I'm not mistaken, dropped 36%. Well, the market maker's not gonna let a coin drop 36% and be like, hey dude, you owe us some money for the losses, right? Where you're borrowing on margin, two to one, three to one, four to one, five to one. So it's a double-edged sword. So when you're on margin, let's say you have $100 in your account and you borrow against it with, let's say, two to one, right? You go and you buy an asset for $200, but you only have 100. And then the asset drops by 20%. Well, you lost 20% on the 100 you put in and then you lost 20% on the 100 that you borrowed. So when the margin call comes in, you are literally down 40% on your $100 investment. Because the other $100 was borrowed money. So it really can be quite damaging when so many people have FOMO and they just go out and they constantly keep buying on margin thinking that the crypto or the market in general only goes higher, right? Because we do get these pullbacks and they come out of the blue. A lot of questions I got was, how did you see it coming? How did you know it was coming? How did you get into the position? You don't know, right? You don't know when POTUS is gonna send out a tweet and raise tariffs on China up to 100%. The call put ratio, could you be looking at that? You could, but it's not. It doesn't predicate that anybody knows what he's going to be doing. Now, I'll mind you, some of the insiders that are in his inner circle, I'm sure, got tipped off that that was coming. And so why do I say that? Well, it was very apparent that when he announced Liberation Day and what they were doing with the tariffs, there were people literally in the White House, billionaires, where he was pointing out this guy made a hundred million today, this guy made 200 million today, this guy made 500 million today. I mean, go back and watch it. Do you think that those guys were just all at the right place at the right time and then they're standing in the Oval Office with record profits? I mean, come on, right? Let's wake up to reality. And so I'm not being political, but I'm stating that there are people that are in the know. Now, are we as retail traders in the know while I sure as hell am not? But a couple of things that you could have watched for at least on Friday, and it was frustrating, right? If you were short the market and I did take some puts, I took some puts on Apple if you were trading live with me, I did not take calls on Friday. I was just really not looking for calls. I was looking for the market to actually go lower, but the problem we had was Nvidia kept making new all time highs and that was holding it up. But once I saw that we could not on a five minute chart, and this was actually after I ended the live, close above 67315, I took a position and I said I am just going to hold this because this is not able to recapture where we were at at a prior all time high that also rejected. We did take some puts here if you were with me on the live. And then when you're watching this, QQQ was making new all time highs, but spy was not. So one other thing that will give you a bit of an indication when the market is potentially going to roll over and we don't know when it is, right? We can't time this stuff, but always look at the financials. So the market is making new all time highs and what are the financials doing? So we'll just look at the overall XLF, okay? So if you look at the XLF on a daily basis and we just go back in time, and so remember, and I talk about this in the master class and I talk about this all the time, that if the financials don't keep going higher, then the market ultimately will not keep going up. Why? Because you need the liquidity. You need the banks to participate and they stopped making highs back here, right, on September 23rd, okay? They're struggling. So we get a lower low, lower high, lower low, lower high, guess what you get? Then you get a dump. So let's go and look at some of these on an individual basis. And you're gonna see this exact same thing. When the market keeps making new all time highs, but the money center banks are selling off, that should be an indicator that we're probably getting close to the top. Now is it gonna be in a day, five days, 10 days, 20 days? Don't know. But you can see how poorly the banks were acting over the last one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine days, right? So whether we're looking at JP Morgan Chase, and this one, you know, is gonna be announcing earnings, we're still below a level. $300 was kind of the magic number that they had to get over, and now we are dropping back below it, okay? But there's not a lot of buyers at these price levels. And as they announce earnings, I don't think they're gonna come out and say anything phenomenal that's gonna push them back to new all time highs. I mean, Jamie Diamond has been quoted saying that this market is too expensive. I mean, hell, when his stock was at like, 230, he said, I'm not even buying it back at these levels. It's way overpriced, okay? So just look at the banks. JP Morgan, let's take a look at Citibank, same exact thing, city made, you know, an all time high back here in September 23rd. It's October 11th. Look at the trend going down. Let's look at Bank of America, and they're all at technical levels, but I would not be buying the banks. Personally, I'd probably be a seller of the banks. Bank of America, another great example, September 23rd. Why is it that all the banks are making all time highs pretty much right around the same timeframe, September 23rd? And then what happened ever since selling, right? Just valuations are too high. Price-detangible book value is too high, and it's just not sustainable. So that's how you get a 10% pullback, right? $86, now we're down here with Wells, it's 77. So yeah, it's a $10, you know, move. That's what about 12, 14%. And again, I'm not necessarily a buyer of the banks. Same thing with the regionals, right? We take a look at, you know, US bank, one of my favorites that I like to talk shit about for good reason, Friday, September 19th. I mean, just awful price action. So it's interesting. You know, Flint was taking call trades on this, and I'm just looking at it going, I don't see it, right? Now, we are at a support level of 45, but we can't even get to 50, or the prior all time highs back here at 53, before they keep rolling this thing over. So I would not be a buyer personally, until we get probably down to 42, or maybe 39. Now, you guys know that I like to play VPST. I've taken a long position in this in the past, but this is another one. Look at this. Friday, September 5th, right? So this one was actually earlier than some of the others where the regionals started to roll. And just look at your trend line, right? Just, it's really simple, guys. If you're gonna go long, go long at a price level, or go short at the trend, okay? And it broke the trend, and it broke the price level. So let's just do this. Let's go from a high, and I'm gonna spend a little extra time today, because it's important that you're able to see this. Look at these candles. Touch the trend, touch the trend, reject the price, short you go, right? Now, you could find some stability here at 81, but you can't take a position, in my opinion, until you hear some of the earnings announcements. Because if they're not good, then we're going lower, right? And so we're gonna want to short this. I probably don't want to short it, but somewhere down here at $70, but if we break below 70, then we're going back down to 56. And the banks, they're a necessary evil. They can be really good or really bad. So that's just kind of a way to look at the markets to know that if banks can't keep going higher, then guess what? You're gonna get a pullback. We just don't know when. So let's take a look at Apple. Apple held up pretty good. You know, it was a 257. We bounced really hard off of the 240 level, which was again, prior resistance, prior resistance. So use these levels. I mean, I'm really confident in my price levels that they are definitely tradable, okay? Now, again, I don't think everybody's just gonna be stepping in and just buying the dip with the bond market closed. Could be wrong, but right, we'll see what happens. Let's look at Amazon. Amazon had a significant pullback as well. You know, a good decent bounce at the last, you know, four hour time frame, but we are still in a sell area, right? Buyers are down here at the 207 level. You can see how this was a major support level in the past, okay? So when we were up here at 238, which is pretty much where we rejected again, 238, and you got this huge flush lower, this was after earnings, okay? They're even though they beat, right? The market sold heavily into it. And then it took the escalator up and the elevator down. So watch these price levels here at the 217 to 15 level. The one I probably like the most is going to be, let me just look left. This was a pivot in the past. I'm gonna leave these on here. I'm just, they're a very close tight knit, but I think you got to get above 218 to go back into to the 222 area, okay? Microsoft, let's take a look at that one. Again, hard bounce right here off of this close liquidity zone between 505 and 506, right? You can see lots of buyers, lots of buyers, but there weren't any buyers in between here. So that's why the market can just keep falling and falling and falling. So even though you're at a price level, when we don't see the buyers, then it's really hard to stop and fight momentum, which I would never do. Let's take a look at Google, right? Google bouncing right off my price level, 233, 34. Again, not necessarily a reason to go long. You know, I'd love to see us pull back into this gap fill, but I think we definitely need more downside in order for long term, the market to push higher. Like a 3% pullback, 3.5% is not a lot, right? We really need something between 5 and 10%. We moved into the gap fill here. I'm gonna watch this on the market open, right? It was kind of struggling, consolidating, almost ahead in shoulders here, right? Before we dump lower with everything else, almost back to this, you know, $400 price level, I mean, but just to think on, you know, October 2nd, a week ago, we were at 480, 480, right? Down to 400. That's a pretty decent drop there. Let's look at Nvidia, Nvidia held up fairly well. It sold off with everything else, but bouncing off the 200 simple moving average, lots of buyers down here. Okay, so clearly we closed this gap fill, so that can now go away. But that's why we keep an eye on these things, right? Where are their gap fills? And is there anything else I wanna be aware of? AMD had a good pullback as well, needless to say though, this thing ran like crazy. So what I wanna do here is I really want to keep an eye on, I don't think this pullback was enough in all honesty. If I were to go from the pivot low to the pivot high, we didn't even get to the 50 fib, okay? So while it did bounce early, and again, this was nosebleed territory, right? 243 down to 207, not much of a drop. I'd love to see us come down into this golden zone before you go long. So we do have obviously, the EMAs crossing to the downside, we're losing some momentum, could get some calls off the open, but we'll see if this is fairly short live there not, right? Time will tell, okay? Palantir bouncing off this price level of 170, same thing, lots of buyers, lots of buyers, lots of buyers. We really need to get some clarity on what's gonna happen with these China tariffs, and how are they going to impact overall, the consumer price index, right? The CPI, which again, we're not gonna know because of the government shutdown. So all the levels, I think are really solid. You could trade against them. I'm very, very confident in them. And I'm confident because you can see, they hold. I mean, literally, I'm to the penny, right? And I mean, we're literally bouncing to the penny, okay? QQQ was a little bit different. We grab a little bit more liquidity, but that's because we have more volatility, obviously with the tech stocks, right? Then with SPI. But again, once they recovered this price level, we are now back up to this 590, right? So do they hold this, or do they reject this and ultimately go lower? So with that everybody, hope to see you Monday morning for live trading at 6.15 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. And if there's anything I can do to help, I just reach out and let me know. But with that, have a phenomenal weekend, and I'll see you all next week. Take care. Thanks for watching.
