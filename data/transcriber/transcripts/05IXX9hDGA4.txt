 Hey, I'm Bill Fanter, founder of Options Action, and you're watching the weekly watchlist. If you'd like to get access to this content before it goes live on YouTube, just hit the first link in the description to sign up for our free weekly emails. Alright, let's jump right in. Hey, welcome back everybody. So this is going to be the watchlist for Monday, September 15th, and it is hard to believe that we are already halfway through the month. So this week I would not expect too much leading into FOMC, which is going to be on Wednesday. But let's just take a look at the overall economic news. Monday, we really don't have anything coming out that's going to impact the markets. I mean, Empire State Manufacturing Survey should pretty much be a moot point. And then Tuesday will be strong, but we're going to have retail sales, import prices, and overall business inventories, and then the home builder conference index leading into the overall FOMC on Wednesday. So I will not be trading on Wednesday morning, the day of FOMC, but instead we will be doing a webinar around fake outs and breakouts. So if you want to join, I will post the link in the discord so that you could join that webinar. I think you're going to absolutely love it. We'll see what the FOMC does, right? Are they going to do 25 basis points? Are they going to do 50 basis points? Could they surprise the market and do 75 basis points? I think it'll be interesting because consumer confidence clearly came in lower than expected. We're watching the overall jobs numbers slow, and inflation is going up. Are we in a stagflation environment? Ah, possibly. That this could last a little bit longer than anyone thinks, but clearly the market is already pricing in many rate cuts yet to come. Now, we will see. Do we get one in September this coming week, and then that's it for the year, and then do they continue with more cuts in 2026? But again, remember, when they're doing rate cuts, it's a sign that the economy is slowing and that unemployment is going up. So the two levers or the two mandates that the Fed is constantly trying to solve for is keeping stable employment and then keeping inflation in check. So we know inflation is going up. Okay, so that's an X against that they should be lowering rates, but then they also have the job market, which is no slowing. So I do believe that the sign of tariffs is now coming into play. You've seen a lot of the retailers starting to so off and having more and more pressure, and we're going to look at one of them shortly here. And then also one of the other transport companies actually will look at two of them to see where that goes. So we're going to watch FOMC Thursday, jobless claims again, we'll give more confirmation as to what's going on in the job market. And then secondly, I think you're all hearing this when people are becoming unemployed, it is taking them forever to find another job. And if they can find another job, they're not getting compensated at the prior level that they were earning at. That is going to be a problem. Okay, so then we also have the Philly Fed Manufacturing Survey, the US leading economic indicators, and then Friday pretty much clear, dry, run, we should not have any issues with this speech from Mary Daley. Okay, so that's what we got going on in the news. Let's take a look at the overall ETFs spy new all-time high on Friday. Again, this is just pure market momentum that they are anticipating that the Fed is going to step in and start cutting rates. Okay, so the market is always forward looking. Now, on an overall earnings basis, the market is fully valued. When you take a look at forward earnings and forward sales for where the market is priced, it is very, very expensive. So therefore, I would not be surprised to see that no matter what Powell does, whether it's a quarter or a half, that the market does come back in and take a reprieve to head lower. So I don't have any really good price levels. I mean, this is super wide. $654 to $658. I'm not going to throw any interim price levels in here just because I don't think that makes sense. When we're trading at all-time highs, typically, the market doesn't make sense from a rational exuberance perspective. Same thing with over here on QQQ. We have a lot of movement that was clearly to the upside. They are just pricing in these rate cuts. The market just tearing higher. You get a pullback, tear higher. You get a pullback, tear higher. And then we'll want to wait and see what comes from this week's overall rate decision. Let's take a look at some of the individual names. Apple was also heading up quite nicely on Friday. Again, new iPhone is coming out. Thinest iPhone ever. So there's getting some more hardware upgrade discussion that's coming into play. But the price levels all look really good, right? I don't need to add anything. I don't need to take anything away. This 230 has been a very, very solid level that once they get above it, they push it all the way up to this 234. We can get back above 234. It can go to 237 and then back to the 240 range. One of the other ones that has sold off a bit that's been making a nice recovery also is Microsoft, right? We were after their last earnings. I mean, they just cranked this thing all the way up here to 561. And then we brought it back down to 494. I mean, think about that. Just kept selling into it. We're going to look at Oracle in a moment here that actually did the same thing. We can see here that we kind of have this other top that I'm going to go ahead and throw a price level in right here. That if we get back up here, I want to be cogniz enough. But in the meantime, right now we got a clear 513 or get a bounce at 506. I really see anything that I need to add in here. You can see we've had consolidation before they go lower consolidation. This stock likes to do a lot of consolidating. Now, last week, it got a huge jump up, a sell off, and then a pump higher. So I would definitely wait and see if this 505, 506 level holds and then bringing us back to 513. If you want, you can throw an interim level in here just to be cognizant of this. And I'm going to do this in blue. This is where they pushed it up to here on August 22nd. They pushed it up to here on August 28th. They were able to clear it and now we are rejecting it in the pre-market. So that's kind of how I would use an interim level to think about Microsoft. Let's take a look at Nvidia. Nvidia is had a really solid line in the sand at 177. This was a prior all time high. So if we were to go back here and look left, we'll just let this catch up. This was a prior all time high that once they got above it, they were bouncing it off of it multiple times. So again, we are now in this area of consolidation right around 177. But every time they get to 177 over the last couple of days, they are just holding this level and they are pushing it higher. So that's what I would watch for Nvidia. Tesla was a real rip around Friday. I mean, this thing took off once it got to 346 or now all the way up here almost at 400. This one is one that I would probably be willing to take a put trade on if we start to see some weakness just because we have the MACD that's going to curl. So we'll watch this in the pre-market hour. If we get back below 393.26, I think you could take some puts to just write it down lower that this thing is well over extended. We only have some 30 minute demand here. So nothing major until we get to a price level, price level and then more buyers down below. I also want to take a look at Oracle. Oracle, I had a short trade on Friday that once it broke below 30460 to go in puts. This was a great example of the earnings where they announced earnings and look at how they missed, right? They missed on both metrics and the stock went up 40%. Why? Because the narrative that they gave was that AI was having an insane impact on their overall revenue stream going forward. They're expecting their revenue to double for like the next 10 years. I mean, it's absolutely ludicrous what they came out instead during the overall press conference. So therefore, right? They run it up overnight and then reality comes in and they start doing the math on the overall data and they're like, this isn't even possible. So what are we looking for? We're looking for at least a pull back to the 55 maybe the 618. This one I still think if we get a pop higher to 30460 or you can get back up here, maybe even watch. Let's do an interim level here. Kind of where this candle body high is and this candle body low. But if they push this thing up here, I definitely think that puts are still in order for Oracle. Let's take a look at CBR, L cracker barrel. They have earnings coming out this week, which are going to be on Wednesday. Again, this thing after their marketing debacle and social media grabbed a hold of it. Clearly some weakness here. So I would not be buying calls, but I think you could definitely be looking at a put trade if this thing can't get above 5136. And then another one that's going to be announcing earnings this week that has been downgraded is earnings on Thursday is going to be FedEx. Remember, we're going to look at UPS in a second, but last time UPS had earnings, they were horrific and the stock just dumped to a 52 week low. So I am not necessarily expecting that FedEx is going to be blowing the numbers off the charts. So this also has to do with the change from an overall tariff perspective on this Minimus Exemption Removal. So what this is is that if you were importing goods and services into the United States under a specific dollar amount, they were exempt. So if you had imports valued under $800, okay, you did not have to pay the tariff tax. Well, the government came in and said, no, no, no, we're removing that. We were now going to have to pay that tariff tax. So that was also what's affecting IWM. All these small companies that are importing maybe goods and services or clothing or wine or toys, right? Small shipments from China under $800 were not subject to the tariff tax. Well, now they are. So this one again, I would be looking for puts can't imagine. You never know, right? I mean, earnings wise, they've done well over the last several quarters, but you can see how we have so much volatility in overall price. Looking at supply and demand, you know, we're pretty fairly balanced here. But again, this $2.29, if we get a weak market, we get negative commentary from the FOMC. They announced the day after. I think this is probably more right to the downside. Speaking of the downside, can't catch a bid here on a little bit of a lemon, right? I mean, just huge gap up above, off of earnings did not do well. This thing I think is probably still heading lower. The next support level I can find really is at $155. And it's actually on a weekly time frame. I mean, that's how bad this stock is sucking wind all the way back here to 2020, right? We are literally back to COVID lows. I mean, it's shocking. So what I'm using here is I'm using the body of the candle, not the whip. The wick is actually all the way down here, okay, at $128. I mean, I think if you lose this body low, then it's probably lights out for this thing to even head lower. So they constantly keep beating on earnings every single quarter, yet they're forward-looking guidance because of tariffs was horrific. So keep an eye on Lulu as well as some of the other retailers that are going to probably head lower. Or conversely, do we get a bounce here at $155 where people just step in and say, this thing is just two-day-im-cheap, right? And does this end up being a story similar to Nike, right, where it was left for dead? Let's go ahead and pull that one up real quick. And we again had some lows down here at $51, but now we're trading back up to $70. So I did have a gap fill box. We're going to remove that. That gap is now closed. And we are now holding this level of $73. And our investor is getting comfortable. It's been holding this level for one, two, three, four, five weeks. So this one probably a good long-term buy and hold for your stock portfolio, okay? This is what we like to see. They get it up to here to 80, sell it to 73. Get it to 80, sell it to 73. So this one, again, I'd be looking for a potential bounce. Okay, we do have a gap still. It is still open below here. So this is a new gap that was created on a gap higher. So we'll go ahead and throw that one in there. Let me just get this candle high right here of $62.73, $62.73. Let me update that. $73. We're good. Okay. Now we're going to save. So we're going to watch this. But I would definitely think that this is a good area that you could potentially start to buy Nike on the turnaround story. So with that, that's what I'm watching. Again, Wednesday. We'll be doing a webinar on fake outs versus breakouts. I think you're really going to enjoy it. I hope you can make it. And with that, if you have any questions, let me know. Have a phenomenal week. And can't wait to see the fireworks between the administration and Jerome Powell. With that, everybody, take care. We'll talk soon. Thanks for watching.
