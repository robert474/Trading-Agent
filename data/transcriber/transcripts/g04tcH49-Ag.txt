 Hey, I'm Bill Fanter, founder of Options Action, and you're watching the weekly watchlist. If you'd like to get access to this content before it goes live on YouTube, just hit the first link in the description to sign up for our free weekly emails. Alright, let's jump right in. I'm going to start with Bitcoin this week, which is the first time I've done this all year. And why am I doing that? Well, first and foremost, this was a big piece of the catalyst as to why the market sold off. And it was actual liquidation. Okay? So what happened with Bitcoin that is a little different with some of the other asset classes that we trade, right? Blue chip stocks, is you can use, depending upon the platform, extreme leverage. So you can trade Bitcoin 10X, 20X, 50X. Some platforms will let you trade it 100X, meaning if you put in a dollar, $1 into your account, you could go buy a $100 worth of Bitcoin. Or if you put $1,000 in your account, you could go buy $100,000 worth of Bitcoin. Well, what happens is when the market starts to lose its footing or lose its hold at a key support level. So a key support level was right around here at 107, right? We can see that this was a clear pivot to a high. We hold it. We hold it. We reject it. We test it. We come down. We test that exact price level again. And then we free fall. So what's happening? Everybody that is levered to Bitcoin on a 10X, 20X, 50X perspective is soon as Bitcoin drops, for example, down to 100 or this 107. And we start to lose this number. Now mind you, people are getting liquidated right here, okay? Because when it drops a dollar, you're not taking a 10% hit to your account. You're taking a 20% or a 30% or a 40% hit to the actual balance. And then what happens is you get a margin call, meaning that when it is going up exponentially, you benefit, but when it starts dropping, you get harmed. Now mind you, when you open this account with $1,000 and you're trading 10X and you buy, so for example, you put in $1,000 and you buy $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, and it drops 10%, well, 10% of $10,000 is $1,000. So your $1,000 you started with is now at zero. If it drops another $1,000, you know all the broker $1,000. If it drops $1,000 after that, you know all the broker and additional $1,000. So that's how you get into these margin calls and people have to start liquidating to get out of their position. The problem with Bitcoin is you can lever it up, again, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100X, you can't do that with stocks. So when you find yourself in this free fall market, I mean, we're just plummeting in $1.2 trillion got liquidated out of Bitcoin. Well what's happening is, as these people have their accounts, right, and it should be a small portion size of the overall asset base, maybe it's 1%, 2%, but the people who are levered up, okay, they then have to start selling regular stocks. They got to sell Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft to cover their losses in Bitcoin. That is why leverage can be so dangerous. It's also why I trade options, right? It could also be so lucrative. But the difference with options, if you're buying calls and buying puts, is that you can't lose more than the cost of the trade, okay? So I mean, that is a key factor with options, which is why we trade them. Here's another price level. As soon as it got below, right, 99 and change, it was really lights out to the downside, okay? So we'll add a couple more price levels. It'll show you where the market really needs to come back in and recover in order for this to start to move back to the upside, right? I kind of like it right in here. Another good example of 92. We're trading at 86, but look at the drop. I mean, this is severe. Nobody is stepping in aggressively and buying this up. Now we'll see what happens over the next week or so. But if we get below 83 and change, my next price level is 74. Personally, I think we're coming down here to 74. Maybe it will, maybe it won't, right? All the Bitcoin, Brosel, hate on this post and talk shit in the comments, but so be it. I mean, if you bought up here, you are what I'm going to consider. You are an official bag holders. Ah, yeah, I know it's going to 200 grand, 300 grand, it's going to a million dollars. But right now, you lost 30-some percent of your investment up here. Yeah. You can dollar cost average in whatever you think works for you. But at the end of the day, you have to understand the environment of who you're playing with. And when you're playing with leverage and speculation, when it doesn't work out for people who don't have deep pockets, this is the end result. Thanks for watching.
