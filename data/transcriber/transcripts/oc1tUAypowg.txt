 Hey, I'm Bill Fanter, founder of Options Action, and you're watching the weekly watchlist. If you'd like to get access to this content before it goes live on YouTube, just hit the first link in the description to sign up for our free weekly emails. Alright, let's jump right in. Hey, welcome back everybody. So this is going to be the watchlist from Monday, October 6th. We do not have any news dropping on the 6th. So we have a Fed governor speaking. I don't anticipate that that's going to move the market. But what will move the market is if we can get some kind of resolution to the government shutdown. So on Friday, one of the most important numbers that the market was heavily relying upon for a potential Fed rate cut later this month was the job's numbers. But we don't have any jobs data because the government has been shut down. So therefore the data will be held until further notice, till it resumes. Right? Now, when we look at ADP data, it was exceptionally weak. Now the one thing that we've seen in the past is ADP says the market data is very weak and the government comes out and says, no, the data is really strong. ADP is wrong. So I want you to remember that ADP is working off of actual payrolls and processing numbers. So how many people are getting a paycheck through ADP? What are their employers doing, which majority of companies in the United States are processing with ADP? Yes, some are using paycheck, some are using ancillary payroll services. But for the most part, most companies, my entire career, have always been on ADP. So they know what people are getting paid. They know if there's high rings, they know if there's firings. Now the government's data is purely survey based. So they send out surveys to a thousand companies and ask them to return the surveys. But what happens if only a hundred companies send back the survey? And they say, yeah, we're hiring, but the other 900 who are laying people off just don't even respond. That is the problem with the government's data. It is not reliable from my perspective, right? It's a survey. Oh, put out what do you want? You know, who's even filling out the survey? Right? Is it some clerk in HR? Is it the HR executive? Is it a hiring manager? Is it something that got delegated? And the one thing we know about the government's data is that it is highly unreliable and that companies are not time sensitive with returning the surveys. I mean, where in the world do you just send out a survey and ask companies to volunteer data? Seems crazy to me in 2025, but who might have speak? So we are not going to probably get the trade deficit number on October 7th. So that will be another important metric. Now, we have a lot more Fed governor speak. I'm not worried about that. I think we're okay from that premise. But what we don't know is some of this narrative going to be around the potential of lowering rates. So do Fed governors come out and say, well, if we don't have the data, then we can't make a good decision to continuing the lowering rate process. That will push the market lower. Now, mind you, we have a lot of that going on on Tuesday as well as Wednesday. Also, we have the minutes of the September FOMC meeting. So on Wednesday, I would not be trading later into the day. It's always a wonky day. But the markets are looking for is there something in the minutes that they're going to try to glean access into that wasn't disclosed at the news conference. I mean, it's just crazy, but it's just how it works. And then on Thursday, we're going to have Jerome Powell having some opening remarks at a conference. We need to watch that. It might not even be trading Thursday morning. We'll see how this goes. We're not going to have jobless claims unless the government's back open again, right? We'll probably get wholesale inventories. And then on Friday, we have consumer sentiment, preliminary, and then again, waiting on the US federal budget. What does that look like? So a lot of this data is going to be predicated on coming to a bipartisan agreement as to funding the US government. So take a look at some of the charts. On Friday, we had a fair amount of selling pressure in SPY as well as QQQ. We have this bearish and golfing candle that essentially wiped out the pre-market movement up as well as the market open as it started to roll over in the afternoon. I really don't like calls. I mean, you could look at them at 6.6937, right, if we hold this level to push higher. If not, I don't necessarily like puts, but we're going to keep an eye on them if we get a close below 6.6937 to have a price target of this 6.673429 respectively. And what is that? That is these four hour pushes over two consecutive days that they could just not get above. And then once they finally made the third attempt, they did it on the fourth attempt. And now they are using that as support. So this will be a very strong line in the sand that unless they can break 6.673429 respectively, I don't think we're going to go lower. But if they do, then target 6.6489 and then down here into the 6.63 and then from there, we'll have room all the way down into the high 650s. So I would love to see the market pull back here to 6.54 and at least retrace some of this huge run-up. On literally no news. Now we are going to have bank earnings that are becoming out enough for another week and a half, two weeks. So that could also give us a little bit more of intel as to what's happening with the consumer. Stay tuned, QQQ. This was relatively weak on Friday. Right? We had this big bearish and golfing candle pushed down. You'll also note that we don't have many buyers here. So we do have our price levels that we can go off of. Now the market is actually post market closing just right below one of the price levels. So this is going to be again a strong line in the sand for them to potentially bounce it. Now look at this again, huge push down to 601. If we fail the 602 levels, then what I would definitely look for is for that push down to that 601. And I think we could definitely retrace this. But we need to get below 602 87 and then just kind of watch for a potential stalling point here. But again, we get below this. We can definitely push lower from this point forward. Let's look at Apple. Apple had the relative strength in the market, right? The market selling off and what is Apple doing trying to push to new wall time highs. Friday, it just gapped up right out of the gate, consolidated, consolidated, consolidated. I would not be surprised if this can hold some momentum at 257 that you could go along into the 260s. So again, I don't necessarily think that I would be shorting this name unless we get below 257 39 on an entire weaker market and the market's rolling over. This will drop. It's just not going to drop as fast as some of the others. Let's take a look at Amazon. And I'm going to stick with large cap tech because I think that's where your greatest risk to reward is. Don't have anything here until we can get back to this 218 to 17 level for a potential bounce. Do note that we have quite a bit of buyers here. Yep. In the Thursday, right? They pushed it down to this interim level, which was also consolidation here. And they made the run higher, but they couldn't hold it. So nothing until we get to 218, I really like this 217 a lot better. Switch to a two hour and you'll kind of see exactly why, right? Lots of structure forming here, here, and here over multiple days. So 218 ideally, right? With the stop loss below 217.06 on a candle closed because if we lose that, then definitely 215 and 213 are going to be in the cards. Let's go ahead and take a look at Microsoft. Microsoft is about 10% 9% off of its all time highs. So if you take a look at this, again, where they ran this thing really hard up here above 550. Okay, let's go ahead and put one more price level up here while we got this. Pushed it all the way up to 562. We're at about 513. So we're down about 9% right? And so what they're doing here is they can't seem to hold it much above this 517, but we keep coming into where there's buyers and they push it up. They'll get into the buyers and push it up. I do like Microsoft long at this 506. A higher risk trade is going to be at 511. But if we do have good relative market strength, go ahead and take some calls and then just trail a trail your stops. Okay, let's go take a look at Google. Another one. More consolidation than anything. We do have this huge gap fill below. So I mean, if we could just get really good weakness in the market for a rollover, right? That's a longer term price target. But right now for calls really like 243 right here at this level, but ideally right here at 238. Okay, 238 Y. They hold it. They hold it. They hold it. We come down and we retest this 238. If we can test this again, then that's where I think you could get a bounce. Not to say you can't get a bounce here at 243, but ideally this is where you're going to get your better bang for your buck. Take a look at Tesla. Tesla announced phenomenal quarterly earnings, which should not be a surprise, not earnings deliveries. The EV text credit was expiring, right? So what did you expect? I mean, everybody's going to run out and use it before September 30th. Now, the, you know, aha moment was, well, oh my gosh, right? If they had a record delivery number for the year, what's going to happen to the next quarter? And then what's going to happen all next year? So they literally bought the rumor, sold the news. Okay? And so therefore, I think there's potential for this one to go lower. We do have a gap down here in the 400 level. Can't say that I would be buying this here, but I would watch it for a potential bounce at this 427.93. See if we bounce it. If we lose this, right, you're coming down, you're grabbing liquidity, you're going up, but they're not sustaining it. And if we come back down here below 427, I think you can go short down into demand. Okay? In video was super strong all week long, making new wall time highs. We have some consolidation here. This one, again, I would be watching for them to make a run back up to this 191 area, possibly 200. So we are getting a bit of a pull back. Okay? So let's go ahead and do this just from a all time high to the pivot low, where might there be a reject? Possibly right at this fib at this 188, right? 188, 14 really aligns with the 55188, 22. We do have some demand that's been forming. So I'm going to go ahead and save this layout and we will watch these fibs to see, are they able to play for us to head lower or do they hold these fibs and then try to push up to the 618 and then possibly the pivot high. But as of right now, they came close to the 55 and then we got a little bit of a pushback, but we're going to really want to see what the market has to offer when it opens tomorrow morning. Let's take a look at AMD. I did catch a phenomenal put trade in this thing when we broke the level and was able to push down. It's holding support at 163. So keep an eye on this again, zooming out to a higher time frame. Ideal for calls is going to be here at 162.11. Could they bounce at 163? Yeah, they kind of held this liquidity, held it here, but ideally this is where you want to go long. Possibly a put trade. And so again, let's just go ahead and use a real simple fib, pivot high, pivot low. Look at how this almost aligns perfectly off by 6 cents with my price level. Watch this for a reject on weakness to go lower. Okay, now I would not be just buying calls right out of the gate here, right? We have this huge massive sell off. So let's watch the buyers come in, right? People who bought here, people who bought higher, do they liquidate their positions and get out. So we're going to go ahead and watch the chips from Monday. I really do like those. Palantir, ton of selling pressure. Again, tied to the government shutdown. Palantir's funding is all around government contracts. And those contracts don't get paid or those contracts get wiped out or the president decided, hey, we're not going to fund these. This is going to be possibly more weakness. So at one point in time, it was down over 7% on Friday. Looks like it closed down 747. So it was actually down a little bit more, probably eight and change. Watching for a reject here, use the VWOP as your possible stop loss for it to push higher. Don't exactly like puts right out of the gate. Let's see what the relative strength is and then we're not going to chase this, right? Let this drop come down to 172 or the 170 area where we can decide, do we want some calls? But there's a fair amount of buyers down here. And again, if the government shutdown gets resolved, look for this to pick up steam back to the upside. Take a look at meta. Meta has been kind of struggling. You'll see that essentially we were approaching this gap fill. Now for all intensive purposes, this candle low here is 710. The bottom of the gap is 708. So what we can do is we can go ahead and we can modify this. This is yet again, another great example, right? Where we push and we finally start to get into the gap, we have weakness. And then the market uses the top of the gap is resistance. And then they're trying to go to the bottom of the gap to fill it. For me, I'm not going to leave a $2 gap on meta. It's just a waste of time. I'll just consider it filled and use my price level of 705. But ideally call bounce down here at 693. I don't miss the calls here and I don't like puts here. But it's something to keep an eye on. Let's take a look at Netflix. So this was a lot of chatter in the market with Elon asking his tens of millions of subscribers to go out and cancel their Netflix subscription. So me this is safe. That was a weight on the market as to obviously person of influence. If they lose 10, 20 million subscribers, don't know that people are just going to go cancel their Netflix subscription because Elon didn't like some propaganda that they were pushing out there. But 114580, definitely possibly for a call trade or a put trade back up here at 117990. But right now we're just kind of trending down. So the market is needs to find a little bit of stability or it needs to pick up the up on this aggression to the downside. But do note that this is where they bounced it in August really hard. So again, I'd be looking for calls. I would not necessarily be looking for puts. Okay. That's everything that's kind of on the radar. Again, patience, right? We're going to have to watch the news flow as to what's going on with the government shutdown. How will that impact not only the broader market, but the real news is going to be in the jobs numbers. But we need to know what the jobs numbers are as to as the FOMC going to lower rates, lower later this month, or do they use us as an excuse to hold steady? I think there's going to be a lot of politicking involved in what they do and how they do it. And the narrative should be intriguing. So grab your popcorn and I will see you all tomorrow morning for live trading at 6AM Pacific Standard Time. With that, have a great Sunday, everybody. We'll all talk soon. Thanks for watching.
