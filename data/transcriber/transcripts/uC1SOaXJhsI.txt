 I always say one of the other things we saw this year too, Ryan, that was kind of an anomaly. It almost took us back to COVID where it was like the year of meme stocks all over again. So, you got a crypto president, you know, very pro crypto. So whether it's Bitcoin or it's a meme coin, when the administration launches his own meme coin and then his wife does and then his kid does, I mean, they're just buying up all kinds of shit coins on the fact that they're just going to go to the moon and what we've watched over and over again. These things just implode. So if you get into the very beginning, it's really good. But if you're going to be the laggard and buy the top, there are so many bag holders.
