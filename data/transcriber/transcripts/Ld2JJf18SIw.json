  "text": " Welcome back everybody. So this is going to be the watchlist for Monday, November 24th, which for us here in the United States will be the week of Thanksgiving. So we are actually wrapping up earnings season. We have a couple of key notable names that I think are going to want to keep an eye on. One in the technology space is going to be Zoom to see what it does as well as Dell and Alibaba. I think those are going to be some that could potentially move the market one way versus the other. And then on the retail side, two names that are going to be key highlights are going to be Coles and Best Buy. So Coles has been going back and forth as to does it go private equity and not become or remain a public traded company. Best Buy obviously impacted immensely by the tariffs is pretty much everything that they sell is imported from somewhere else in the world. But I think these could be two really good names for you to get some phenomenal trades off of. So let's go ahead and take a look at the actual US economic calendar. Obviously economic news has been kind of on a hiatus with the government closed. But we should start getting a massive stream of data coming in. Now Monday, there's nothing. Okay, so that's a good thing. Tuesday looks like right now we're going to get retail sales. That's going to be important to measure the strength of the consumer. We're going to look at the producer price index. So what is it costing manufacturers to actually produce the goods that they sell? Very, very important number are going to be the PPI, right? The producer price index. So where are we at with the core? Where are we at year over a year? What is happening with inflation? Is it still remained elevated? No mind you, the next FOMC meeting is going to be in December and the Fed has a dual mandate. Okay, first mandate is maintain a reasonable amount of inflation of 2% or less right now inflation is north of 2%. And then the second part is make sure that we have a strong healthy job market. We know unequivocally that jobs are slowing as the unemployment rate has now ticked over 4.1%, which is the highest it's been since the COVID downtrend. Okay, the other thing we're going to want to watch is home prices. Home prices are now starting to drop. They are becoming cheaper than actual new construction. So I would also kind of keep an ion some of the home builders and then consumer confidence consumer confidence keeps dropping lower and lower. So we have a big news day on Tuesday. Wednesday we're going to flow into jobless claims and durable goods orders. Okay, so the jobless claims number is going to be the one that's going to move the market. What is happening with people that are unemployed or people that are becoming unemployed is that number going up or going down. Now on Thursday is the Thanksgiving holiday, so the markets are closed and then on Friday the market will close early. So while the market will be open it will close out 1 o'clock PM Eastern, which is going to be 11 o'clock AM Pacific. Okay, so just kind of adjust your timelines between the East Coast and the West Coast. I would highly highly advise that you do not trade on Friday. The beauty about trading is that you don't need to do it every day. Volume is going to be exceptionally low. You're going to get a lot of chop in the market. It's Friday. You're going to have month end. Yeah, you can get some order flows in one way or the other, but at the end of the day from a risk to reward basis, you're putting on more risk for way less reward. So for those of you that are celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday, just make it a long weekend. Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, come back Monday. Okay, so with that, let's go ahead and get into some of the charts. I'm going to start with Bitcoin this week, which is the first time I've done this all year. And why am I doing that? Well, first and foremost, this was a big piece of the catalyst as to why the market sold off and it was actual liquidation. Okay, so what happened with Bitcoin that is a little different with some of the other asset classes that we trade, right? Blue chip stocks is you can use, depending upon the platform, extreme leverage. So you can trade Bitcoin 10X, 20X, 50X. Some platforms will let you trade it 100X, meaning if you put in a dollar, $1 into your account, you can go by $100 worth of Bitcoin. Or if you put $1,000 in your account, you could go by $100,000 worth of Bitcoin. Well, what happens is when the market starts to lose its footing or lose its hold at a key support level. So a key support level was right around here at 107, right? We can see that this was a clear pivot to a high. We hold it. We hold it. We reject it. We test it. We come down. We test that exact price level again. And then we free fall. So what's happening? Everybody that is levered to Bitcoin on a 10X, 20X, 50X perspective is soon as Bitcoin drops, for example, down to 100 or this 107. And we start to lose this number. Now mind you, people are getting liquidated right here, okay? Because when it drops a dollar, you're not taking a 10% hit to your account. You're taking a 20% or a 30% or a 40% hit to the actual balance. And then what happens is you get a margin call, meaning that when it is going up exponentially, you benefit, but when it starts dropping, you get harmed. Now mind you, when you open this account with $1,000 and you're trading 10X and you buy, so for example, you put in $1,000 and you buy $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, then it drops 10%, well, 10% of $10,000 is $1,000. So your $1,000, you started with is now at zero. If it drops another $1,000, you know all the broker $1,000. If it drops a thousand after that, you know all the broker and additional $1,000. So that's how you get into these margin calls and people have to start liquidating to get out of their position. Now, the problem with Bitcoin is you can lever it up, again, 1020, 30, 40, 50, 100X, you can't do that with stocks. So when you find yourself in this free fall market, I mean, we're just plummeting in $1.2 trillion got liquidated out of Bitcoin. Well, what's happening is, as these people have their accounts, right, and it should be a small portion size of the overall asset base. Maybe it's 1%, 2%, but the people who are levered up, okay, they then have to start selling regular stocks. They got to sell Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft to cover their losses in Bitcoin. That is why leverage can be so dangerous. It's also why I trade options, right? It could also be so lucrative. But the difference with options, if you're buying calls and buying puts, is that you can't lose more than the cost of the trade, okay? So I mean, that is a key factor with options, which is why we trade them. Here's another price level. As soon as it got below, right, 99 and change, it was really lights out to the downside, okay? So we'll add a couple more price levels. It'll show you where the market really needs to come back in and recover in order for this to start to move back to the upside. Right? I kind of like it right in here. Another good example of 92. We're trading at 86. But look at the drop. I mean, this is severe. Nobody is stepping in aggressively and buying this up. Now, we'll see what happens over the next week or so. But if we get below 83 and change, my next price level is 74. Personally, I think we're coming down here to 74. Maybe it will, maybe it won't, right? All the Bitcoin, Brosel, hate on this post and talk shit in the comments. But so be it. I mean, if you bought up here, you are what I'm going to consider. You are an official bag holders. Ah, yeah, I know it's going to 200 grand, 300 grand, it's going to a million dollars. But right now, you lost 30 some percent of your investment up here. Yeah, you can dollar cost average in whatever you think works for you. But at the end of the day, you have to understand the environment of who you're playing with. And when you're playing with leverage, in speculation, when it doesn't work out for people who don't have deep pockets, this is the end result. Okay, so let's keep things in context again, not judging it. But I'm just telling you structurally how the market works. Okay, let's take a look at Spy. Spy actually held up better. A lot of this had to do also with the banks. The banks did not come down dramatically. Let me go ahead and clean this up. We'll zoom in so we can see where we're at structural basis here. But Spy got a bit of a better bounce than the Q's did. So when we're looking at this on a, you know, two hour time frame, no, we are still in a downtrend. This was this push higher. Okay, on Thursday of last week, and then just the massive sell off. Okay, so this was after Nvidia's earnings, right, Nvidia announces the market pushes higher and then just relentless selling the entire day. This is structural damage to the market. Okay, so you want to pay attention to events like this. The market pushed up here to the Fib level. So here's one thing that you can do in combination with your price levels is right. Do a Fib pivot high to pivot low where are we going to reject? Well, we rejected exactly in the golden zone, right? I mean, literally in the center of it. This was perfect right here. Reject, we are now heading back lower. Okay, let's take a look at, and this Fib is now from my perspective no longer needed. But here's what you also had. You had a 55 with a price level. As soon as you lost that again on the way down, that was your indication to take puts or go short. Let's go ahead and take a look at QQQ. This one did not get the bounce like spy got. So remember with spy, we're talking the SMP 500, you know, with the 500 largest market cap stocks. Here we're talking really tech. This one got, I believe, to the 50 Fib. If I'm not mistaken, this is why we use Confluence Trading here. We, nah, we actually fell short of the 55. So I mean, it did not even get the juice higher that we saw with the SPY and with the SPY, we saw that again, they were buying up the banks, they were buying up the airlines, they were buying up oil, they were buying up pharmaceuticals. So they were going to where there is more safety, which is not in the technology realm. Let's take a look at some individual names. I'm going to start with Apple. This guy held up really good in all honesty. So, you know, just kind of zooming out, right, where the market was selling off hard with chips and semiconductors and, you know, Oracle, hammered, hammered, hammered. You can see that this one is actually still trading within its zone, right? So some good price level targets here to trade off of. 265, definitely. We're holding here at this 270. 270, I still, if the market shows some strength going into Monday, I like this right here for calls, right? 270, 80. Get a little bit of a push down. Ideally, I'd rather have it down here at 269 and change. Optimally, I'd really love it to have it down here at 265. I don't know that you're going to get it. But just looking at this overall structure, this is still bullish, right? They'll push Apple down and then we resume higher to the upside. So we do have a fair amount of buyers and sellers overlapping here. But I do think 27414 is a good price for this to move higher. Let's go ahead and take a look at Amazon. Amazon actually closed the gap to the downside. Lot of weakness in this one, right? So this was your prior earnings gap right here that existed. Okay? And this is why we put gaps. Look at how the market free fell all the way through that gap to the downside. So that is considered close. We have some potential room back to the upside. Lot of a lot of price damage done here. And this is why we keep gaps on the daily timeframe because once a stock enters the gap, it will feel that gap 80 to 90% of the time. I do like calls if you get above 22235, if not potentially some puts back to the downside. Again, mind you, the market is still trending down. So I would not get aggressively bullish on this one. We do have a lot of buyers here. So could be hard to push lower. But if you could get above that 222, potentially some room back to the upside, probably more of a scalp than anything. Directional trend. I will see if there's a Santa Claus rally that comes in between now and the end of the year. As you never know, let's look at Microsoft. This one, another one, a fair amount of overall structural damage. Why? Because it's so tied to Nvidia. And open AI in the tech trade. So if we could get above this 47334, which was prior consolidation here to the left, I do like calls if not just let this one settle. But this one again is, you know, had quite a fierce pullback. And I don't think there's any reason to really jump into it. Let's take a look at meta. So this one is actually trading at a PE multiple that is back on a very, very low basis. So this one I actually like, probably also possibly if the market settles down here is not necessarily as an option play, but an equity play. Remember, this was just trading at $800, right? We're at $591. The ideal place to get this is the gap filled down here at the bottom. So maybe you do dollar cost average in. I think I would be patient this week to really see what the overall market sentiment is. Or do we get more pressure to the downside is people look to lock in profits to hold their gains and not give any of them back. But this $591.71 looks good for me for potential calls. I really like this $586. I don't know that we're going to push down here, but you can see again, fair more buyers sellers are only at a 45 minute time frame. You're going to run into more resistance up here at 606. So I do like meta for the calls out of a gate on Monday. Just take a look at Google. This thing has had just super dad strength. Just holding and holding and holding kind of immune to what's going on in the entire market, right? It got it's a little bit of a drawdown here on Thursday, but we are right back up here on Friday, right at 300. So this one I wouldn't chase if you own this one. Sell some out of the money covered calls, but I really do like the strength in this compared to everything else. Now do I want to be buying a 303 personally? I don't. You know, I really the opportunity is down here. I think at 270 or 275. I don't think you need to pay up this 300 level, especially if the market decides to roll over. So you can look at Tesla. Tesla is actually showing relative weakness. It did get a bit of a pop higher on Friday, and I know that we played some calls in the discord, but again, below this 400 level, I think is going to be really psychological and 393.26. So for the most part on this one, I think there's more downside pressure to come. We'll see how this actually plays out. We don't have a lot of buyers here, right? And if we get below this order block, the next order block is way down here at 366 down here at 350. And then we have a gap to the downside. So this one I actually like for puts, you know, a lot of volatility that you could trade this name, right? Get some good calls and good puts to the up and to the downside. But right now, my bias for this one is to the downside. And there's your reason why. Let's talk about the open the room in video. Fantastic earnings insane revenue blowing it out of the water. And the big sell. I mean, whoo, it was up 6% post market finished down 3% talk about wiping billions of dollars a market cap out in a single day. Did get a pop higher? Okay, on Friday, they couldn't hold it sold into it. We are coming back down here. This one, if you open below 17938, which is my price level, and we have weakness on the market, I think we had lower. Okay, but you got to get above 17938 to take your calls. If not, I do like puts. Again, we were all the way down here on Friday at 173. Ultimately, I like to see this income down to 150. I don't know that we're going to get it. But that would be a much better buy zone at 150 to 160, right? Lots and lots of buyers down here at these price levels. You can see this and you can see it by the number of lines I have and the overall consolidation. And then you can again, kind of see right down here. We have a ton of overlapping buyers. We start to get below 150. Then it's going to get a little bit concerning. But these are fairly low level. Again, not a lot of buyers to hold this up at this 30 minute block. So again, I think puts, if the market is weak down to this order block, we break the order block. 171, we get below 171. I would not probably try to short this thing. We have one week buyers, three hour buyers, three hour, I mean, we have four hour. We have a lot of buyers here, right? Where you would have to see some really overall market structural damage on this one. So good AMD. I talked about this one on Friday. We do have a gap below that you want to pay attention to if we get weakness. Again, this thing just ripped throughout the entire second half of this year. But I'd love to see this gap fill to the downside and get back to the 172 range, which I think it makes more good sense if you want to buy equity on this one. Again, no need to be buying up here. Let it come down here where you get a better value, which was driven higher exponentially, right? Nice push up and let this close and then take your long position. Now, when we have a gap, obviously, you'll see that we will bounce off the top of the gap. So do keep that in mind. But look at where we have the buyers here. And then we don't have really any buyers till significantly, at a later point in time. So again, I think you get below this, this buy zone here, this gap could definitely fill. So keep an eye on AMD. The high flying stocks, right? I mean, they're just getting destroyed. Let's look at Ocklow. This one just right decimated. It was all the way up here at $193. We're now trading down here at $85. Again, I think if you have weakness in this, you can short this one. One of the other ones, QBTS, another tremendous amount of damage. Again, these are, these are people chasing the market on companies that don't make any money. And we're right back down here, right? This thing was just trade. Think about this. So someone bought a $4670. Remember, because for every seller, there's a buyer. Somebody bought a $4670. We're now trading at $20. I mean, these stocks have been halved. So stay away from the quantum computing. I mean, if you want to monkey around with them, so be it, but don't put on a lot of size. And my recommendation is just trade where you know you're going to have, you know, a really good amount of volume being in your your Apple, your Amazon, your Google, right? You're in video. Things along those lines. Let's take a look at Palantir. So Palantir, I kind of put in between these two. Great company, tremendous amount of revenue coming from the Department of War, the Defense Department, right? But again, not to say that this thing can't go higher, but the overall valuation just doesn't make sense. And when valuations don't make sense, they turn into a bubble, right? And then they will drop lower, not to say this can't go back to 200 because it surely can. But right now we have weakness, right? So trade with the market is giving you not what you think it's going to do long term, right? There's a difference between trading and investing. We are trading. I'm not investing here, right? Investing is completely different. And then let's finish where I started. Micro strategy. This thing is getting pummeled because of Bitcoin. And the one thing you're going to want to watch is even if Bitcoin recovers, do they even come back and buy strategy? I think their investors have literally gotten screwed so hard that nobody long term is going to want to be holding this stock that is a company Michael Sailor runs. I mean, people were buying this at 456. We are less than 50% of the way down and we are showing more weakness. Again, you're going into an overall area of demand. But at the end of the day, trade options don't buy this stock, right? I mean, this just doesn't make sense. We are going to have earnings coming up, you know, investors are worried about this stock. I mean, do your homework on it. Do your research on it. But, you know, this thing in its preferred shares, you know, maybe worth a look. But at the end of the day, I would steer clear of this volatility, right? Or if you're going to take advantage of it, short into the downside. Because we all know that fear is stronger than greed. And you can see that right here that when the market drops, I mean, it is unrelenting. You don't have that continual basis, right? On the pops, they're just bigger, right? Whereas when the selling starts, it's really hard to stop the bleeding. So with that, guys, you know, trade smart this week. Again, I would highly advise, you know, Monday, Tuesday should be pretty good days. Day before Thanksgiving, volume drops. The day after Thanksgiving, don't even trade it, right? That's just my two cents. But do whatever you want. However, I can help reach out. Let me know in with that for those of you that are celebrating Thanksgiving. I hope you have an absolutely wonderful holiday itself as well as the several days after. And then finally, should have said this at the beginning, there are two huge, huge, huge sales that are coming up. One is with trade Zella, okay? Which on the annual subscription is like 30% off. And then the other is with trading view that is 80% off. So I'm going to drop those links in the email. And I would highly encourage you to take advantage of both those offers. And they apply to whether you're a new subscriber or you're an existing subscriber, save yourself some money. So with that, everybody, happy Thanksgiving. And we will all talk next week. Take care.",
