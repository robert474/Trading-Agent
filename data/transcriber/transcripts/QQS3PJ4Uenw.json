  "text": " Hey, welcome back everybody. This is going to be the watch list for Monday, October 27th. So let's go ahead and start with the economic calendar now clearly because the US government is still on lockdown, I guess not lockdown. It's shut down. Same thing, right? Nothing's getting accomplished. We're not going to get a lot of the data that we want to see, although we did get CPI on Friday. Now here's the funny thing about CPI. It came in, hotter than expected, but long term directional bias, it's getting closer to where the FOMC is targeting for inflation. Now, however, it was 3% higher than it was a year ago. So things that you're seeing that are costing more, and I'm even noticing this myself in the grocery store, right? Coffee. Coffee is going through the roof. Meets, especially beef, is going dramatically higher. Vegetables, fruits, I bought three apples the other day. This is crazy. Three apples, good size apples, right? Get to the register. $10. I almost told them to take the apples off my shopping cart. It was just, I'm thinking, what in the hell is going on here? But that is what is happening with things that we import. Now, we do have more news rhetoric between us and Canada due to a Ronald Reagan ad that ran around inflation that the president did not like. So we are now taking all negotiations with Canada, totally offline. And now we are assessing another 10% premium on the tariff. So it's literally tit for tat, right? Who pissed in your sandbox? And it's just getting ridiculous nowadays from my perspective as a consumer, right? But let's go ahead and see what we can trade off from a news perspective. We are going to have the case Schiller home price index. So we're going to want to watch overall home prices. Now they have been coming down as inventory is starting to build. Yes, mortgage rates are coming lower down to around 6%. You can probably get a 30 year fixed, five and three quarters, right? Pay a point, five and a half somewhere in there, still decent. But the problem is everybody who owns a home is pretty much locked in somewhere between two and four percent. So do I want to get rid of my mortgage at three percent or two and seven eighths? I had two and five eighths was my last mortgage in California. And I'm like, well, I am not getting rid of two and five eighths unless I can go somewhere and pay cash. Which is exactly what I did, right? Sold the house of California, made a ton of money, came to Vegas, cash done easy, no mortgage. Okay? But if you got to go out and get another mortgage on a million dollar home, and I know most people are like, what are you talking about a million dollar home? Where can you buy a home in this country in a major metropolitan area where you're not going to have a ridiculous commute for less than a million dollars? I just don't see it. Whether it's L.A., New York, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, I mean, for Kranau loud, home prices are not coming down. We're also going to have consumer confidence. And then what we'd love to see again is more economic data, which we are not going to get, but we are going to get the much anticipated FOMC rate decision on Wednesday. So Wednesday morning, we will not be trading live, but we will be doing a webinar for each of you in the discord that morning, probably right around 7 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. So we're going to not trade that day because it makes zero cents. Options premiums are quite expensive. The market chops around and I promise you, statistically, if you just keep trading every morning of FOMC, over time, you will lose 10 times more money than you will make. It is just a statistical fact. So we don't trade FOMC mornings. It makes no sense. Now, if you want to trade at the press conference or after the press conference, then that's another story, right? And that's probably more along the lines of power hour to see how the market digest the overall rate cut or do they hold steady. My guess is they're going to cut rates at least a quarter percent. And then what the market's going to want to know is do we have one more rate cut this year? Okay. Thursday, what we would love to see is jobless claims in GDP. We're not getting it. And then all the inflationary data, personal income, consumer spending, which is so important to understand should this market be staying at all time highs. Okay. Now what's going to be dependent upon whether or not we get a correction that we're looking for? It's not probably going to be what the FOMC has to say, but it's going to be about earnings. Okay. We have a big week coming up ahead of us. So if you look, we have all of the heavy hitters we have on Wednesday, meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, all after the bell. Okay. We also then on Thursday are going to have Amazon. We're going to have Apple. We're going to have Coinbase. This past week we already had Tesla. We're going to take a look at the Tesla stock and kind of see how that responded. And then we're going to start to hear from the oil companies. But what I want you to keep in mind is that one third of the S&P 500 weighted index as to where prices are trading are due to the mag seven Microsoft, Alphabet, Microsoft, meta, Amazon, right. These guys are holding up the entire stock market for not only SPY but QQQ. So what is going to be interesting to listen to is going to be the capital spend. Okay. It's not going to be about the revenue. It's going to be are they going to keep pouring more and more money billions of dollars into AI and infrastructure. Now we're going to look at these stocks because they are not making new all time highs with the exception of Alphabet and Apple. The other ones are still five to eight percent lower than their prior all time highs. So this is going to be a big week again. We got a full MC on Wednesday. We have a lot of tech earnings. So Thursday will probably give us a little bit better insight. Okay. Let's go ahead and take a look at some of the charts. So we're just going to look at the technical aspect. So this is SPY. You can see we had a huge gap up on that CPI number on Friday, which again to me doesn't make a lot of sense when it's still not cooling dramatically your over year. But the market wanted to hear that with a Fed rate cut and it literally shot up higher. We do have a gap fill below that I'll keep an eye on other than that. I'm looking for a pullback to at least this 673. Possibly the top of the gap fill. Okay. Now mind you here's how liquidity works. And I want you to pay attention to this. If you saw what the gap was, right? This is what we're going to want to observe is the top of the gap going forward to see do they come down and bounce it or do they start to get into the gap, reject it and head lower and go for our prior all time high, which was this 673.94, which is where the market was consolidating ahead of the actual open. Okay. Let's go ahead and look at the cues. Same exact thing. Right. This was a prior all time high, 613.18. What did the market do with the pre-market literally bounced off of it and before the bell could even ring we created a gap. Now I was actually able to take a wonderful call position here on the bounce of the top of the gap. Now ironically that also lined up with guess what the orb. Okay. So if you're going to look at the opening range breakout it is right here. This is the bottom of the orb. So we had again great strength. I didn't have an opportunity or one an opportunity to short the high but again don't fight the trend. Come down here by your calls and up we go. Okay. So we'll keep an eye on this as the week progresses but right now 618.42 all the way down here to 615. I you could get an interim level maybe here at about 615.6616 you know that you might want to keep an eye on but for right now I think just patience is key. Let me show you one other thing. So this would have been something else you could have done as well is just did the Fibri Tracement. Okay. On the pre-market high and low and look at where the market bounced. On the open at the 55. Look where it bounced later in the morning at 7.55am the 55. Okay. So use your fibs when you don't have a predetermined price level to trade off of. Let's go ahead and look at some of the big names. So let's go ahead and start with Apple again pushing up to the all time highs from prior in the week. So you could see where we're at you know it had a lot of relative strength. Good momentum to the upside right we're just kind of holding right here. Now again if I wanted to take an interim level where would I look to want to buy? Probably right around here in this area 262. Now again we are going to have earnings an ideal position to buy would be at the 55 which is down right at that 260 level. So if we can push down to 260 should be able to hold quite a bit of support enable to move higher and you can see we have a lot of buyers down here. So man quite a bit of sellers up above. So this one again I think you have to be patient but the buy signal right down here which I know USC Iceman took a trade on as did we during the life and his trade went up as he got into this trade and we stabilized it was a 300% banger and then note how it goes from liquidity level pretty much to liquidity level right. So now what we want is we want a decent pullback to say could we get an entry and then if I was going to do an interim level probably some are right around here 262 right this was the pre market high they did a draw on liquidity right at the close and that would be something to keep your eye on one more thing if you want a little bit more confirmation to say you know a safer level would be back down here at 261 okay so just taking the pivot load to the pivot high within the daily and see how that reacts as well so we'll go ahead and watch that for later in the week and because this is an interim level for me I'm going to change it from yellow to blue okay we'll just watch and see how that gets observed. Let's go ahead and take a look at Amazon Amazon again with everything else. It had a strong week this entire week for the most part right we're able to get some good momentum Thursday going into Friday rejecting this 25 to 25 but again well off the all-time highs of you know 242 so doing some consolidation right here within this range again I'd want to see us get above 225 to go long don't necessarily like puts you can see we have some interim demand forming right here but we really have the sellers up here at 228 but again a safer trade is go ahead and wait till you get above and hold that 225 level. Let's look at Microsoft a lot of back and forth on this one right so we're back here to this 525 23 high right this was not the all-time high the all-time high is all the way up here at 562 and change okay so again the market's making new all-time highs but this mag seven is not so it's been a broadening of the market so again above 525 I think you're good for calls possible bounce down here at this 522 you can see how they've been pulling liquidity a little bit lower on this one so this is another great example of where I would kind of just watch and say well where would be a better entry and you can see it kind of right here right they keep getting down to this 522 08 but if they break these pivots and you go long then that's where you we just want to stop out of the trade but right now we have a lot of sellers we have quite a bit of buyers at 522 but I don't want to buy and go right into the sellers I want to see sellers all the way up here so this is one for me that I would just say I'm just gonna stay away from a Google making new all-time highs 261 68 again we did have a trend line here that they were able to hold we didn't even get the retest this is what I was watching for on Friday could I get a retested this to go long I never got it they did hold my 256 level so that was decent I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of the trend line and now we need to push above 261 68 in order to take some calls but you'll know right we don't have many sellers up here because we're all time highs a better buy is gonna be at this 250 but mind you again they have earnings and then there was a gust posted in the discord someone placed an insane put trade at the 250 level on alphabet I mean for the tens of millions of dollars in premium paid so this one is gonna be interesting to see how this plays out let's look at Tesla Tesla did not have great earnings which was ironic and ultimately what happened right they missed okay was it very pretty nothing look good but they sold it off off of earnings in the pre market and then for whatever reason they just bought it right back up right Elon Musk comes out and talks about the future future of robot taxis future of robots and they bought it up and then what did they do they sold right into it on Friday literally no momentum so if you look at this stock on a four hour time frame it is literally just chopping back and forth in this range right here back and forth back and forth me I'd like to see them come down here to this 398 level and fill this gap before they actually decide to make a move higher now we are making higher lows okay which is a plus with the exception of this candle right here so again I think just patience on this one let them pull this thing back 10% down to you know 490 and change and then I think it's a good long position let's go ahead and take a look at Nvidia Nvidia is another intriguing one that again it is struggling all week it can't really get any momentum above this 187 we've just been oscillating back and forth between 180 187 so we go up we come down we go up we come down we go up and they are not breaking through this so we need to see them break above this 187 35 188 to go back to potentially all time highs of 195 which was back here about two weeks ago right so it's not holding up and making new higher highs we're getting a little bit of a pullback now watching it on a four hour time frame right we had a high a low a lower high we did not get a lower low and now we are getting a higher high from this pivot so watch for the reversal back to the upside but again a lot of it I think is going to be dependent upon FOMC as well as what is going on with big cap tech earnings AMD making new all time highs again we got a gap below I like this buying this at you know 235 ideally you'd want to see a pullback all the way down here to 170 we're not getting that anytime soon but then we do have a longer duration trend line all the way up here at 272 so if I go out to a daily time frame okay and zoom out and look at this long term time frame right so it starts back here in 2021 we go then to 2024 and just following this higher this thing has just been an insane ripper to the upside we do have a couple of gaps right but the news has been so strong and look at this MACD I mean this is insane now again they're going to have earnings but not till the first week of November so we got to wait a little bit longer here for AMD this is one that I won trade I don't think you need to trade it premiums are just too darn expensive and I think there's just better opportunity elsewhere so just my two cents I'll stick a look at Intel Intel was interesting it announced earnings ran up 7% in the after hours and then they just sold into it right I mean they're like not having it there was a gap fill up above so you could have watched that to see was that gonna you know fill and then push to 44 which was my next price level they got it up to the gap fill and said that's a no we're we're all taking profits here so that was kind of interesting to just watch that dichotomy do keep an eye on this I think if you get back down here to this 37 range 3710 you could take it for a bounce we should have a lot of buyers here yeah fair amount of buyers right but if we get below this I don't know that I necessarily like puts again this stock has been you know really strong to the upside but seeing it do this off of earnings is not encouraging okay so keep an eye on Intel 3710 let's go ahead and take a look at meta meta it's gonna be another one that again kept struggling right could not get above this 740 level they get above fail get above fail get above fail get above fail get above fail okay we have a lot of sellers up here the concern with meta has a lot to do with the fact of cash on balance they had an insane billions and billions and billions of dollars of cash okay now they are taking on an insurmountable amount of debt to build out AI and that's why it is going to be so imperative to listen as to what is going to be the cap expend for these companies and are they going to dial up back so if they're not going to be buying chips and they're not going to be building you know the semiconductor sector and they're not going to be building out AI is quickly is what they were anticipating because the debt load is building these things are going to sell off okay and then the entire market will obviously sell off with it but the concerning thing you know to me again is you know they're pushing all the way up here at almost 800 and then just after a trickle down it's been consolidating right looks like it's ripe for a move higher but we do have an awful lot of sellers up here so keep that one on watch as well let's go ahead and take a look at PayPal this one I think there's an opportunity here for a potential break higher if we get above 70 74 again they're going to have earnings this week on Tuesday okay so this thing has just been you know beaten down for the longest time right this was one of those phenomenal covid stocks that at an all-time high you know is all the way up here at $300 a share right and now we have just been you know kind of wandering aimlessly back here all the way from August until most recent off of overall consolidation now they did have earnings back here right they beat on both the top and bottom line but the market didn't give it any love okay and so this had to do with a lot of headwinds with international currency translations and how weak the US dollar is right they're a payment provider they move money so when the US dollar is weak their business gets hurt okay don't know that I would necessarily short this but look at this phenomenal consolidation in here and it is going to move one way or the other my bias would be to the upside not necessarily further to the downside and then again we do have a a lot of buyers sitting below so should be interesting maybe do a little research on PayPal I think that's one worth looking at as is um UPS UPS is the other one that has just been doing this consolidating for the longest time right come all the way back here to August same exact setup right these look very similar to one another where we are just in a range in a range in a range and then we need a catalyst now the problem with UPS is last quarter it did not guide higher and then again it was struggling with overall revenue a couple of things with UPS um they lost their biggest contract uh being Amazon which was intentional from their perspective because the margins were so low but then again the tariffs uh that were impacting Chinese imports and imports from around the world does impact the overall packages that are moved right so therefore tariffs and seeing how it was impacting their business huge huge sell-off but we do have a nice gap above and this is right part of the transport business and a uh a really important component to the overall economy no different than FedEx's but again look at this right going all the way back here to covid right I mean crazy right this was a $226 stock that is you know 70% cheaper and just because it's cheap doesn't mean that it's a buy and then you know over time again remember we only chart gaps on the higher timeframes but you can see that we have a gap up here right we have a small gap right here right below the price level uh but ideally you know if this thing has bound uh uh uh based if you will and we've been having good MACD buying traction but just not enough to be a catalyst higher so again we do have earnings coming up this one will be something to keep an eye on and then quantum computing right I did take a trade on this one uh let's take a look at QBTS right the wave quantum um push this thing insanely all the way up here to a 40 some box got a really good pullback down to 26 right that's a 50% haircut uh caught a little bit of a bid on some rumors that you know the US government was going to start buying into quantum computing companies and take an equity stake of somewhere you know around 10% I did catch a nice put trade on this once it fell below uh the price level of uh 32 51 right so this was the news on the White House potentially taking you know a stake in it we got a good pullback it gets another leg higher but if we get below 32 51 I think you can definitely try some puts I would definitely be doing puts below 29 18 okay so we don't have any buyers here and these things you know will just sell off super quick now you also have to be very careful because the bid ask is really wide okay so when you're getting into these um you have to be very patient and I would even consider placing a by limit order which I normally don't do I normally do by market but the bid ask is super super super wide on these things but when it pays it pays exponentially so those are kind of things that I'm watching this week and for those of you um that are in the discord I will see you Monday morning for some live trading again don't get your hopes up too much this week everybody's going to be watching tech earnings everybody's going to be watching what the FOMC says the markets are at all time highs it's okay not to take a trade it's okay just to watch you're not missing anything okay and protecting capital is the number one name of the game so with that everybody have a phenomenal week ahead and uh happy Halloween I hope you're uh gonna go out and do something fun and with that I will see you all at the beginning of the trading session tomorrow and if not we'll catch up next weekend where we'll be able to look at how did each of these stocks respond and we are going to enter the month of November so happy Halloween everybody take care",
