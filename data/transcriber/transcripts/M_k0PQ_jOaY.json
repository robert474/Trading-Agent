  "text": " Welcome back everybody. This is going to be the Watchlist for Monday, November 17th. So, a couple of things that we're going to want to watch for is going to be earnings coming out of the retailers. So, some of the big box names that we're going to want to really keep our attention on are going to be the Home Depot. We have Lowe's Target, TJX, as well as Walmart. Okay? So, why is this important? Well, we're going to be looking for consumer spending going into the holiday part of the year. Now, the elephant in the room, which is either going to allow this market to sustain its current trajectory or which could cause a house of cards to come tumbling down, is going to be Wednesday with Nvidia. Okay? So, the stock is expected to move between 6 to 7%. So, based upon word-stating, it will either push back up to its all-time highs or will retrace significantly lower. Now, mind you. If Jensen Wong comes out and says anything around slowing of AI spending, which I highly doubt, or to the effect that the overall AI market trend is cooling, that's not going to bode well for any of the semiconductor chips, right? Whether it's going to be Nvidia, AMD, SuperMicro, any S.A. class with regard to chips, right? And then it's also going to probably bring down some of the data centers. So, it's going to pull in your Microsoft, it's going to pull in your Amazon, it's going to pull in your Google. Okay? But we don't want to have a bias or a trade ongoing into it. Let the news drop and then trade around it. It's so much easier. So, the other reason why I don't play earnings with options is the premiums are juiced up significantly. And they're juiced up to the point that it's already pricing in a move of 6 to 7% in one direction or the other. So, if you're wrong, you will have what's called IV Crush, where you literally paid maybe $400 for a contract. It gets the 6% move and that contract implodes to $100. Right? You need to really beat the expectation significantly for the actual premium to have appreciation where you walk away with the bag of money. Okay? So, that's why I don't typically ever play earnings. And if you're on the wrong side of the trade and you go in calls and they disappoint, you just get destroyed. Right? And you can't get out of the trade because it's not going to recover by the time Friday comes around. So, you don't have time on your side. Okay? So, let's keep an eye on that. One of the other things that we should start getting is economic news now that the federal government is back open. Now, there really isn't anything from Monday other than the Empire State Manufacturing Survey. That ain't going to move the markets. We'll see if we get import prices, right? Industrial production and capacity. Maybe, maybe not. But then Wednesday, we are going to have housing starts, building permit, U.S. trade deficit. And that should be out along with the minutes of the October FOMC meeting. So, the issue that is spooking the market is twofold. One, they're not certain that the FOMC is going to lower rates in December like they hit originally anticipated. Okay? So, there was a lot of Fed governor speak last week saying, well, we really don't have any data. The government's been closed. We don't have CPI. We don't have PPI. We don't have unemployment numbers. We don't have enough data to make a decision. And this is a data driven Federal Reserve. Now, the White House came out and said when they release unemployment on Thursday, that it was probable that they would not give an actual unemployment rate. Okay? Whether it's going up or down, they would just state the number and then leave it at that. Now, we're also going to want to watch initial jobless claims, home sales, and then again, a lot of Federal Reserve governors are going to be speaking next Thursday afternoon. Thursday morning is going to be the morning to watch. Wednesday before these FOMC meeting minutes come out, I would not be in a trade. Okay? And then Friday, we are going to get some inflationary data. This is what we want to see. Right? PMI. What is it actually telling us along with consumer sentiment? Now, consumer sentiment has literally fallen to a 40 year low. Let's see if that holds up or if the government revises the numbers higher. Okay? So those are some of the things that we're going to want to definitely keep our eye on. Let's go ahead and take a look at a couple charts. And I'm going to see on a higher time frame. We're going to start with the ETFs. I called this out in the discord along with the charts for you to see what was most likely going to happen Friday. And on Friday, I said, do not look for puts on this open. You should be looking for calls. Sure enough, what happened on Friday right here? Right? The 14th, they bought the market up and they bought it up hard. What happened when it got down to this same point in time the Friday before they bought the market up and they bought it up hard? So history does repeat itself. We literally bounced right off of this level right here on this low of this 663 30. Okay? Well, it was actually 663 27. I was off by three cents. Let's call that just a rounding error. Okay? So we are now moving up a little bit of a pullback into the close. So what I would watch for is with regard to not only price levels, but let's watch this fib, especially the 15 the 618, which is at this 669 37 right when these fibs align with price levels. That should give you added confidence to take a call trade or a put trade on a directional bias. Now let's take a look at QQ feel same exact thing right. I mean this thing literally pushed all the way down. Now you're not seeing a touch to the penny here, but where it did touch to the penny was in the futures data. So you have to be watching ES and NQ simultaneously same exact premise here. What I would be watching right. Are we going to be able to hold this 607 16 and if not, I'm going to be looking for a bounce somewhere here within the golden zone in order for us to resume higher. Okay? So I'm going to hold those fibs on my charts for the week. Let's take a look at Apple. We did a great call trade on Apple. We made some really nice money on this one. Again, when the overall market was down on the open, you know, 1.7 1.8% what was still hovering near break even. Well, it was Apple and we played into the relative strength. Okay? Now if you stayed in this trade for the majority of the day, you really printed because we caught the call trade right here at 270 80 right. I originally called out that I wanted to buy a 269 13 with confluence. I never got there. We did take our call entry right here at 270 for the 272 50s. And this thing went literally all the way up to 276. You want to talk about a 300 400% ROI. That's what these trades are. So again, you got to stay in them a little longer. Watch it on the higher time frames right and to run a one minute watching on a five watching on a 15. But we never got a pullback below the close of 278. So you could have stayed in that trade. Let's go ahead and take a look at Amazon. This one's going to be interesting. This is one of the only stocks that has not had the gap filled to the bottom. Okay. They filled the gap on Tesla. They filled the gap on meta. They filled the gap on Nvidia. They filled the gap on just about every stock that was out there oracle that all the gaps have filled. This is the only big opening gap. Now they did bounce it off the top of the gap. Okay, to push higher. But now we are heading back to it. When you typically see this roll over and again, even on a higher time frame, right. We are negative traction. The nine is below the 21. I would look to see if this doesn't hold and we have weakness in the market. This would be a great gap filled to play to the downside. Okay, let's say look at Microsoft Microsoft did have some decent strength throughout the week didn't sell off too much like some of the other stocks. We did get a push down here, right. The prior week down to Thursday. And then for the most part, it's been able to hold this, you know, 500 price level. We keep pushing up to this 510. We really need to be able to break above this. We do have positive traction on not only the EMAs, but the MACD. We are above VWOP. So this one, keep an eye on this because of Microsoft doesn't sell off. Then it's going to be really hard for the overall ETFs to drop. Okay, say, look at Google Google. We'll see if they get some excitement in this Warren Buffett took a position back in Q3. Okay, but Q3 is when the stock was all the way down here at 236. It's now at 276. So likely Warren already got in 15 to 20% lower than words trading now. We pushed right off in this 270 price level, which was this pivot high. So if you were to look at this candle high and this candle low to the penny, right. Same exact thing here. We're holding this 276. I would look for if we can hold this, will we be able to move higher? Okay, so add 291. This is real time hours trading. If you were to look at this in the extended hours, then you'll see why that yellow line pushes all the way up here. Okay, but what I've been trading on lately has been the regular time trading hours just to watch and see how the market is adjusting to what's happening pre and post market. Yes, this one, another one gap filled to the bottom right we had the daily gap down here clearly at filled they're pushing this higher. We really need to hold the psychological 400 level right now the market is right below my price level. EMAs are still negative on a higher time frame doesn't mean that they can't change right. But this one is really sold off significantly and we'll need to see if they can recapture 40480 to get back to 412 to then that 420 psychological number. Earlier I mentioned Nvidia, you know, is going to be the one to watch. Now this one's going to be really hard to trade this week because it's probably not going to move too much right nobody's going to want to get in or out of their position in Nvidia before earnings they're probably just going to stay in you know hang tight on the status quo. Here was the prior gap fill right in this area here obviously it closed we are moving higher EMAs are still negative but we are above VWOP so the likelihood that we're going to just chop in here is pretty good. But if we can get above 191 you might be able to play a little bit of strength going into earnings up to 195 or 200 now I told you that the stock is expected to move you know about 7% so that would be what about 15 16 dollars. If we go 15 dollars on 16 on 191, we're almost 200 back up to this 210 and then it will chase this gap fill up here. AMD let's take a look at this. This ton of strength this past week they really did not sell down AMD I mean this thing is holding Lisa Sue was on CNBC doing an interview the stock literally gap up 12% on that day and you could just see the overall strength now we have this huge gap below but right now we're not showing much weakness right nine is above the 21 on a daily. You know we're a little below VWOP but overall this is a hard one to short guys the yellow line is a longer term trend line right that I would like to see us get up to or over before you really go long but you know a lot of strength in this one so do be careful if you're going to try to short it and then also the contracts are going to probably be fairly on the expensive side. Let's take a look at Palantir this one had a really rough week a lot of a lot of selling in this thing right we were all the way up here at you know 207 we're now trading at 175 so talk about a haircut we're definitely in a downtrend we're just bouncing off of VWOP so if you want to trade this one I think these you know 170 price level is pretty darn good to trade off of just before the market close we've got the EMA's rolling over but they are holding VWOP. I really want to see us get below 170 to drop significantly lower of course you know layer on your supply and demand the likelihood that we're going to push down immensely is not really good especially with one day demand that's pretty heavy strength which is why we got the bounce down here at 164 so again when you're trying to short you have to know where your sellers and where you're overall buyers so I'm not going to review any more stocks this week but if you have some of these things you can see the other things are going to be a little bit more difficult to do. This week but if you have something that you want me to look at go ahead and shoot me an email I'm happy to chartered out and send it back to you and with that again just patience pays right we're getting toward the latter part of the year the volume is starting to slow up a bit although we did have some decent volume over the last week and again with that volatility so you can see that the volume started to pick up on these Fridays right Friday and then it died down all week. Right where do we pick up volume this past Friday we'll want to see if it starts to die down all week but do be cautious when you have volume days that are trading at half of what it normally is because that's where you just have the erratic price movement so we'll keep an eye on everything I'll be trading live Monday Wednesday Friday USC iceman will be trading Tuesday Thursday and we should have you know another really good week so you know if you want to if you're not trading with us come trade with us I think you'll learn a lot it's very very easy to do it. It's very educational if not for anything it's it's definitely worth your time so with that everybody have a fantastic Sunday and I will see you all bright and early tomorrow morning take care.",
