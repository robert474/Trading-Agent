He emphasizes buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news pattern, discusses gap fill strategies on daily timeframes, and provides specific supply/demand zones for major names. Key theme is market overvaluation concerns and AI spending skepticism weighing on tech despite strong earnings, with reduced volume expected into year-end.",
