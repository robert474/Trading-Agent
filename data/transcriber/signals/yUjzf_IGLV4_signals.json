    "Support and resistance levels are stronger on higher timeframes (daily, 4-hour, 1-hour) compared to lower timeframes like 1-minute",
    "Use moving averages to confirm horizontal support/resistance levels - when they align, it creates stronger zones",
    "ATR (Average True Range) helps determine logical stop loss placement to avoid getting stopped out prematurely",
    "Always establish CEST before entering a trade: Conditions, Entry, Stop loss, and Target",
    "Draw support/resistance levels first, then turn on moving averages to see if they align for confluence",
    "Psychological round numbers are important levels where the market tends to react",
    "Multiple touches with rejections indicate stronger support/resistance levels",
    "High volume zones combined with pivot highs/lows create more reliable levels",
    "Use ATR to determine if price movement from support to resistance is reasonable within your trading timeframe",
    "Don't overload charts with too many indicators trying to get excessive confirmation - this can cause you to miss entries",
    "If you don't know where you'll exit before entering a trade, you shouldn't take the trade",
    "Market behavior follows patterns similar to human psychology - we are creatures of habit",
    "When looking for building zones with large distances, use Fibonacci to identify middle areas if ATR shows smaller typical moves"

  "summary": "This is an educational webinar by Bill Fanter and Alberto focused on teaching how to combine support/resistance zones with ATR (Average True Range) for better trade planning and risk management. The presentation emphasizes the importance of identifying strong horizontal support/resistance levels on higher timeframes, using ATR to set logical stop losses, and always having a complete CEST (Conditions, Entry, Stop, Target) plan before entering any trade. The content is conceptual and educational rather than providing specific trade calls.",
