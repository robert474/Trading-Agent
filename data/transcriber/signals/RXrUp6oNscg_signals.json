  "summary": "Bill Fanter provides a detailed trade recap of a QQQ call trade that gained over 100% in less than two minutes after the market open on Friday. He explains how he identified the setup using positive PCE inflation data, consumer spending data, multiple timeframe analysis (1-min and 5-min charts), VIX analysis, futures levels, and supply/demand zones. He then took a second winning trade shorting into a fibonacci golden zone rejection for an additional $1,700 profit.",
