  "summary": "Bill Fanter provides a comprehensive weekly watchlist focusing on major tech stocks ahead of FOMC meeting and big tech earnings. He emphasizes using Fibonacci levels, opening range breakouts, and liquidity zones for entries. Key teaching point: avoid trading FOMC mornings due to statistical long-term losses, and wait patiently for price to come to predetermined support levels rather than chasing. He notes the Mag 7 stocks are not making new highs despite market strength, suggesting potential correction risk.",
